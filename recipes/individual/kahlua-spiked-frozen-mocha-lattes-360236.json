Cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture just begins to boil, whisking often, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add 1 1/2 cups water and half and half; whisk to blend. Transfer to pitcher. Pour espresso mixture into ice cube trays, filling cubes almost to top (mixture will make about 45 ice cubes). Freeze espresso mixture in trays.
