        "Working with 4 inner eggplant slices, reserving the remaining slices for another use, rub the salt into both sides of each slice and let the eggplant drain in a colander for 10 minutes. Rinse the eggplant and pat it dry. Brush both sides of each eggplant slice with the oil and on a baking sheet broil the eggplant under a preheated broiler about 3 inches form the heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until it is golden and tender. Spread the goat cheese on the eggplant, top it with the tomato, and sprinkle the tomato with the parsley. Beginning with a short side roll up the slices."
