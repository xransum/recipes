Grill corn away from direct heat until just cooked and beginning to brown in a few places, turning frequently, about 10 minutes. Alternatively, omit brushing corn with olive oil and cook in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 6 minutes, drain. Serve corn with shallot-thyme butter."
