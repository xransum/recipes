    "Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate. Add onions to skillet and stir 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Add nectar and lime juice, then rum. Boil until sauce is lightly thickened and reduced to 1/2 cup, scraping up any browned bits, about 6 minutes. Mix in chopped cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet; simmer until heated through, about 1 minute.",
