Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate. Add onions to skillet and stir 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Add nectar and lime juice, then rum. Boil until sauce is lightly thickened and reduced to 1/2 cup, scraping up any browned bits, about 6 minutes. Mix in chopped cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet; simmer until heated through, about 1 minute.",
