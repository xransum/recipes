        "Unfold pastry sheets onto a lightly floured surface. Top each sheet with 1/2 of the spinach mixture and spread evenly. Starting with the short side, roll each like a jelly roll around the filling. Place rolls on a plate and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.",

        "Bake in the preheated oven until pastries are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer pastries to a wire rack to cool, about 10 minutes."
