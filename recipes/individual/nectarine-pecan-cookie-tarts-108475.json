        "Finely chop pecans with sugar in processor. Add flour and salt; process 30 seconds to blend. Add butter; process just until clumps form. Gather dough together; flatten into rectangle. Wrap in plastic; chill 30 minutes.",
        "Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out dough on lightly floured work surface to generous 12x10-inch rectangle. Trim edges just to even sides. Cut dough into eight 5x3-inch rectangles. Transfer rectangles to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Chill while preparing topping.",
        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Combine pecans, sugar, and butter in processor. Process until pecans are very finely chopped. Add egg white and process until well blended. Divide pecan topping equally among dough rect-angles; spread to within 1/4 inch of edges. Bake until pecan topping is set but cookies are still pale, about 10 minutes. Remove cookies from oven; maintain oven temperature.",
        "Thinly slice nectarine halves, keeping slices from each half together. Arrange 1 nectarine half atop each cookie, fanning slices decoratively. Return to oven and bake until cookies are light golden around edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer baking sheet with tarts to rack.",
        "Bring apricot preserves and 1 tablespoon water to simmer in heavy small saucepan. Strain glaze through sieve set over bowl. Brush glaze over nectarine slices. Cool tarts completely on baking sheet. (Tarts can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm any remaining glaze and brush over tarts before serving, if desired.)"
