    "Add the chocolate and coconut oil to a glass bowl and place over a pot with simmering water until melted. Whisk the mixture together, take the bowl off the heat and let cool to room temperature.",
    "Meanwhile, blow up the water balloons. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread out the wafers on the parchment.",
    "Dip one end of each balloon into the cooled chocolate mixture and place each balloon chocolate-side down on top of a wafer, waiting a second before releasing to set. Allow to set completely, refrigerating if desired to speed up the process.",
