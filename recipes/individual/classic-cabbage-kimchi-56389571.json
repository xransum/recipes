        "Rinse the cabbage, and then quarter the heads lengthwise. Place the pieces in a large pot or bucket, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the salt over them. Set aside for 1 hour.",
        "Rinse the cabbage under cold running water, and pat it dry. Cut the cabbage into 1-inch pieces, put them in a large bowl, and toss with the remaining 3 tablespoons salt. Let sit for 2 hours. The salt will draw out moisture from the cabbage.",
        "Drain off the accumulated liquid and lightly rinse the cabbage. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage with all the remaining ingredients, and toss well. Transfer the mixture to a large crock and push the mixture down to force the liquid to rise to the top, somewhat submerging the cabbage in its spicy surroundings. Cover it with a lid and store it in a cool, dark place for 3 days to ferment and mature.",
        "Once the kimchi is tasting all kinds of yummy, transfer it to clean jars (I like quarts), cap them, and store in the fridge (which will inhibit further fermentation) for up to a month or process according to the jar manufacturer's directions to store on the shelf for up to 9 months."
