Pour off fat from baking sheets, reserving 1 tablespoon. Add water and vinegar to pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and gently simmer, skimming off foam occasionally, 1 1/2 hours.",

        "Strain soup through a fine-mesh sieve and discard solids. Skim any remaining foam and taste broth. To intensify flavor, transfer soup to a clean pot and boil to desired concentration."
