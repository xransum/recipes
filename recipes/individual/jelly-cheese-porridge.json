        "In a saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining water and cornmeal. When the water boils, gradually add the cornmeal mixture so that the water stays at a boil. Cook, stirring frequently to prevent lumps, for 30 to 40 minutes. Mix in the maple syrup and cinnamon, adjusting to taste if desired. Spoon into bowls to serve and top with cottage cheese and grape jelly."
