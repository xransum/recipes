Add chopped jalape\u00f1o chilies and stir until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds and stir until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Immediately pour onion mixture over potatoes and stir to coat. Mix in low-fat yogurt, cucumber and tomatoes. Season raita to taste with salt and pepper. Cover tightly and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours. (Raita can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerate.) Garnish raita with fresh cilantro leaves and serve."
