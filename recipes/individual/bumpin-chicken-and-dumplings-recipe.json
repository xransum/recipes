Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, and parsley. Reduce the heat and bring to a simmer. Add the gnocchi and chicken. Toss well to combine. Mix in the mozzarella and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Pour the mixture into the baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Bake until the cheese is melted and nicely browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven, garnish with the basil leaves and serve."
