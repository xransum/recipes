        "Working over a bowl pit the cherries, discarding the pits and reserving the cherries and any juices in the bowl, and into the cherries stir the cornstarch, 2/3 cups of the sugar, the lemon juice, and almond extract. In a small bowl stir together the flour, the baking powder, the salt, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and the butter, blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal, and stir in 1/4 cup boiling water, stirring until the batter is just combined. In an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or flameproof baking dish bring the cherry mixture to a boil, drop the batter by heaping tablespoons onto it, and bake the cobbler in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top is golden. Serve the cobbler with the ice cream.",
        "In a saucepan combine the peaches, the granulated sugar, and 1/4 cup water and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the peaches are soft. Pur\u00e9e the mixture in a food processor or blender, force the pur\u00e9e through a fine sieve into a bowl, and let it cool. In the pan, cleaned, cook the brown sugar with 1/4 cup water over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is dissolved. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the yolks and the whole egg until they are frothy, beat in the brown sugar syrup, and beat the mixture until it is thick and pale. Stir in the half-and-half, scalded, pour the mixture into the pan and cook it over moderately low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, to 175\u00b0F. on a candy thermometer. Strain the custard through the fine sieve into another large bowl, let it cool, and stir in the peach pur\u00e9e, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, and the peach schnapps. Freeze the mixture in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Makes about 1 quart."
