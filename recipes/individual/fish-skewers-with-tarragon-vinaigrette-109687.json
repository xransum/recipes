        "Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk oil, vinegar, shallots, tarragon, and mustard in small bowl to blend. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Place fish in pie dish. Pour half of vinaigrette over and turn to coat. Marinate 15 minutes at room temperature. Thread fish onto 4 metal skewers, about 5 chunks per skewer. Grill until fish chunks are just opaque in center, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, toss baby greens with remaining tarragon vinaigrette. Divide salad among 4 plates. Place fish skewers atop greens and serve immediately."
