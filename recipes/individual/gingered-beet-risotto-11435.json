        "In a large heavy saucepan cook onion, gingerroot, and garlic in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Stir in rice and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring, until absorbed. Continue simmering and adding beet broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding next, until about half of broth has been added. Stir in chopped beets and beet leaves and continue simmering and adding broth in same manner until rice is tender but still al dente, about 18 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.",
