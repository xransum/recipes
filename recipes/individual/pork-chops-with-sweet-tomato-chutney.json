        "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seed, mustard seed, and cinnamon stick. Cook and stir until seeds are fragrant and begin to pop, about 1 minute. Stir in the fennel seed and then add the tomatoes. Season with cayenne pepper and salt. Pour in the water, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the tomatoes are very soft, about 20 minutes.",
        "Stir the sugar in with the tomatoes and set the heat to high. Cook until sugar has dissolved, then continue to cook while stirring constantly until the mixture is glossy, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "Season the pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops on each side until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for a few minutes.",
