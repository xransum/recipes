  "directions": [
    "Cut off and discard top of each lemongrass stalk, leaving 6-inch stalk, then smash stalks with side of large heavy knife. Cut each stalk in half crosswise.",
    "In 8-quart stock pot over moderately high heat, combine all ingredients and 3 quarts cold water. Bring to simmer, skimming froth, then reduce heat to moderately low and gently simmer, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 45 minutes.",
    "Remove chicken, reserving for another use, then strain consommé through fine-mesh sieve into large bowl, discarding solids. If using consommé right away, skim off and discard any fat. If making ahead, cool consommé completely, uncovered, then chill, covered, and discard any solidified fat. (Consommé can be chilled up to 3 days or frozen 1 month.) Rewarm consommé before serving by bringing to gentle simmer in large pot over moderately high heat.)"
