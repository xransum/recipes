    "Pulse nuts, herb flowers, garlic, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Whir in olive oil and Parmesan, if using.",
    "*Spread nuts on a baking sheet and toast them in a 350°F oven—tossing occasionally, for a consistent color—for about 8 minutes, or until they start to turn golden brown and release a strong nutty scent.",
    "**Fennel, lemon balm, and marjoram flowers also make good pesto.",
    "If you want to store a bit of summer in a jar, put this pesto in your freezer and pull it out when you are most coveting spicy sunny days. I freeze mine in an ice cube tray and then transfer the frozen cubes to freezer bags so I can use a bit at a time."
