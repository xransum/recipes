        "Blend all cr\u00eape ingredients except butter in a blender until smooth. Chill batter 30 minutes.",
        "Brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with some butter, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Holding skillet off heat, pour in 1/4 cup batter, immediately swirling and tilting to create a thin, even layer. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly. Next cr\u00eape will be better.) Return skillet to heat and cook until just set and pale golden around edges, 10 to 15 seconds.",
        "Flip cr\u00eape carefully and cook until underside is just cooked through and pale golden, about 20 seconds more. Transfer cr\u00eape to a large plate. Make 4 more with remaining batter (5 more if first cr\u00eape stuck to skillet), buttering skillet each time and stacking cr\u00eapes on plate as made.",
        "Stir together cream cheese, butter, shallot, cumin, and pepper in a small bowl until smooth.",
        "Put 1 cr\u00eape on a work surface and spread with 3 tablespoons cheese filling. Fold 3 ham slices in half crosswise and put over lower half of cr\u00eape. Scatter 1/4 cup watercress over ham. Starting at end with ham, tightly roll up cr\u00eape, enclosing ham and watercress, to form an 8-inch log. Make 4 more logs in same manner. Cut each log crosswise into 6 pieces."
