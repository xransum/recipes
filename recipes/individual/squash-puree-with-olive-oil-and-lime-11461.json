        "In a steamer set over boiling water steam the squash, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is very tender. Reserve the steaming liquid and force the squash through a ricer or food mill set over a large bowl. Stir in the oil, the lime juice, and enough of the reserved steaming liquid to reach the desired consistency and season the squash pur\u00e9e with the nutmeg and salt and pepper. The squash pur\u00e9e may be made 3 days in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated, adding additional water as needed."
