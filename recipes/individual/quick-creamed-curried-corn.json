        "Husk the ears of sweet corn and stand an ear upright in a skillet with the top pointing up. Use a sharp kitchen knife to slice off the kernels, working from top to bottom and rotating the ear after each cut. Use the back of the knife to scrape extra juices into skillet. Repeat with remaining ear of corn.",
