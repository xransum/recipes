        "To prepare the ganache, put the chocolate in a double-boiler or a heatproof bowl over simmering water. When the chocolate is almost melted, remove from the heat and stir from the center out with a rubber spatula until smooth.",
        "Combine the garlic and olive oil in a small skillet and just heat it through over low heat. Pour in a stream over the melted chocolate while stirring gently with the spatula, again from the center out. Season with salt to taste. Add the lime juice and stir gently to blend smoothly. The mixture will thicken like mayonnaise. Keep at room temperature.",
        "When you are ready to serve, warm the sauce over simmering water if it has become too stiff. Toast the bread on both sides on a grill or under the broiler. Arrange the toasted slices on a large platter or flat basket lined with a plantain-leaf square. Accompany with the sauce in a bowl or cruet, the coarse salt, and a couple of decorative butter knives. \u00a1Delicioso!"
