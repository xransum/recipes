        "Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes. The top of the cake will form a brownie like crust before it is done.  Allow to cool for 60 minutes in the pan, then cool completely on a wire rack before glazing.",
        "To make the chocolate glaze:    Mix together reserved 3/4 cup frosting mix and 2 tablespoons boiling water, stirring until smooth.  Thin with additional boiling water if necessary to reach desired consistency.  Spoon glaze over the cooled cake."
