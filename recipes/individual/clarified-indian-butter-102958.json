        "Bring butter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Once foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low. Continue to cook butter, stirring occasionally, until a thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching constantly and stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until solids turn light brown and butter deepens to golden and turns translucent and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove ghee from heat and pour through a sieve lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth into a jar."
