Spread the salami and herb mixture on one of the cut sides and top with the other half of the Brie wheel. Place the Brie in the center of the sheet of puff pastry. Fold the puff pastry up and over the Brie, pressing to secure the pastry together using a little bit of water if necessary. Brush the pastry with beaten egg.",
