In a small bowl mash 1/2 cup beans with a fork and return mashed and whole beans to pan with reserved liquid. Chop 1 cup arugula and stir into beans (off heat) with garlic paste, onion, parsley, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Keep bean salad warm, covered, over very low heat while cooking arugula.",

        "Rinse and pat dry tuna. On a plate combine tuna steaks with remaining tablespoon lemon juice, turning to coat, and sprinkle both sides with fennel seeds, pepper, and salt to taste. Grill fish on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 3 minutes on each side, or until barely cooked through. (Alternatively, fish may be cooked in a heated well-seasoned ridged grill pan in same manner.)",
