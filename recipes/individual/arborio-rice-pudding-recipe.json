        "Take a large saucepan and add milk, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla bean and seeds. Cook the rice in boiling water until al dente. Once the water has evaporated fold in milk mixture. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes stirring regularly until rice is tender. Add the orange zest and pinch of salt. Stir well and remove from heat. The consistency should be more liquid than regular risotto. Finish with a light dust of cinnamon."
