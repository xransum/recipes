Divide dough in half and roll out each half between 2 sheets of wax paper into a 5 1/2-inch round (about 1/4 inch thick). Remove top sheets of wax paper and trim rounds to make perfect circles. Invert rounds onto an ungreased baking sheet and carefully remove remaining sheets of wax paper. Bake rounds in middle of oven until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Cool shortbread on sheet on a rack 5 minutes and transfer to rack to cool completely.",
