        "Combine vinegar, wine, shallots, 2 tarragon sprigs and peppercorns in heavy small saucepan. Boil until mixture is reduced to \u00a7 cup, about 20 minutes. Strain into bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to saucepan; discard solids in strainer. Bring liquid to simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk in \u00a7 cup butter, 1 piece at a time, allowing each piece to melt before adding the next (do not boil). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover saucepan to keep warm.",
        "Melt 2 teaspoons butter in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add scallops and cook just until opaque in center, about 1 minute per side. Spoon sauce onto plates. Arrange scallops atop sauce. Garnish with additional tarragon sprigs, if desired, and serve."
