    "In a small shallow bowl stir together seeds, salt, and cayenne. In a small bowl stir together water and cornstarch until combined well.",
    "In a 3-quart heavy kettle heat oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360°F. Working quickly (do not let oil overheat), brush one side of each of 2 won ton wrappers with cornstarch mixture and gently press coated sides into seed mixture. Shake off any excess seeds from wrappers and fry wrappers, turning them over once, until golden, 8 to 10 seconds total. (Some seeds will fall off during frying.) With tongs transfer crisps as fried to brown paper or paper towels to drain. Make more crisps, 2 at a time, in same manner. (Crisps may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Before serving, ‒recrisp– crisps in a 225°F oven 10 to 15 minutes.)"
