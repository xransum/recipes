        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the potatoes and let cook until tender. While the potatoes cook, in a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper.  Drain the potatoes, stir them into the vinegar mixture and let them marinate for 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream and heavy cream.  Fold this creamy mixture into the potato mixture along with the onions and hard-cooked eggs.  Cover and chill before serving if you wish.  (This salad keeps for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.)"
