        "Rub the duckling well with salt, a little ground ginger, and ground cloves. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in a 325\u00b0F. oven for 1 1/4 hours. Remove duck from oven and place in a deep iron casserole. Pour warmed cognac over it and ignite. Add Muscadet, onions stuck with cloves, carrots and beurre mani\u00e9. Blend. Return to oven to cook for 30 minutes, basting duck occasionally with liquid in casserole.",
        "Meanwhile peel and slice the potatoes and brown them well in the butter. They should cook until they are just soft but crisp around the edges and on the outside. Shake the pan from time to time to keep them from sticking on the bottom. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
        "Add the raisins to the duck mixture in casserole and cook for a further 10 minutes, basting once. To serve, arrange duck on a hot platter and surround it with potatoes. Pour a little of the sauce over the duck and serve the rest in a sauce boat.",
        "With this, drink chilled Muscadet."
