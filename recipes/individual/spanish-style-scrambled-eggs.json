        "In a bowl, beat together eggs and milk until well combined. Stir the shrimp into the skillet with the potatoes and leek, then pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook gently, stirring the eggs frequently, until the curds of egg are almost dry and the shrimp are pink and opaque, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with hot pepper sauce to serve."
