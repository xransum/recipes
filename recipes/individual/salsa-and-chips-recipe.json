        "In a small bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, coriander. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour. Serve with Tortilla Chips.",
        "Pour the oil into a large heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 2 inches. Place a deep-frying thermometer in the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat to 360 degrees F.",
        "Meanwhile, stack the tortillas, and cut the pile into sixths to make chips.",
        "Raise the heat to high. Working in batches, fry the chips, turning them with a skimmer or slotted spoon, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chips to a paper towel-lined pan to drain. (Return the oil to the proper temperature between batches.) Cool and season with salt. Serve."
