        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Generously butter every other cup in 12-cup muffin pan. Place 1 phyllo rectangle on work surface; cover remaining phyllo with damp cloth to prevent drying. Brush rectangle with melted butter; sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Place second phyllo rectangle atop first; brush with butter and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Repeat 3 more times; top with 1 more rectangle and brush with butter, making stack of 6 rectangles. Using small sharp knife and 6-inch-diameter plate as guide, cut out two 6-inch round stacks. Press each stack into 1 buttered muffin cup. Repeat entire procedure 2 more times, making 4 more phyllo cups (6 total). Bake cups until golden and crisp, about 15 minutes. Carefully lift cups, twisting slightly to loosen; place on rack. Cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)",
        "Whisk 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually whisk in milk, then yolks. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Whisk over medium heat until pastry cream thickens and boils, about 6 minutes. Strain pastry cream into small bowl; press plastic wrap directly onto surface. Chill until cold, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.",
        "Preheat broiler. Place phyllo cups on small baking sheet. Spoon 1/3 cup pastry cream into each cup. Overlap 5 or 6 banana slices atop pastry cream in each cup. Sprinkle bananas with additional sugar. Broil pastries until sugar topping caramelizes, turning sheet for even browning, about 2 minutes. Transfer cups to plates. Scoop sorbet alongside."
