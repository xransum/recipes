    "Place the kale leaves in a food processor and pulse until they are finely chopped. Cut the avocados in half, and remove the pits. Scoop out the flesh and place in a large wooden or metal bowl. Add salt and mash with the back of a wooden spoon until desired texture is reachedâ€”I like mine a bit chunky. Stir in kale leaves and remaining ingredients. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt.",
    "Place a piece of plastic wrap directly over the surface of the dip. Store in the refrigerator up to 10 hours. Serve with whole grain tortilla chips, toasted whole wheat pita wedges, or toasted soft corn tortillas."
