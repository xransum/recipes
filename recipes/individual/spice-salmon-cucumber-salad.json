        "In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt, 2 Tbs. of the lemon juice, the 1 Tbs. tandoori spice, the cayenne, garlic, ginger, 1/2 tsp. of the sea salt and a pinch of black pepper. Add the salmon fillets, coating them with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, in a bowl, stir together the cucumber, onion, tomato, the remaining 2 Tbs. lemon juice, the remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, a pinch of pepper, 1 Tbs. of the olive oil and 1 Tbs. of the cilantro. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
        "Position a rack in the uppermost position of an oven and preheat the broiler. Line the bottom of a broiler pan with aluminum foil and place the rack on top.",
        "Remove the fish from the marinade and brush off the excess. Drizzle the fillets with the remaining 2 Tbs. olive oil and season with salt, black pepper and the 1/4 tsp. tandoori spice. Arrange the fillets on the prepared pan so they are not touching. Broil until they are a golden rose color and slightly opaque in the center, 5 to 6 minutes.",
        "Remove the fish from the oven, cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 2 minutes. Serve with the cucumber salad and garnish with the remaining 1 Tbs. cilantro. Serves 4.",
