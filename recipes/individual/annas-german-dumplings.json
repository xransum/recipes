        "Place the milk and salt in a saucepan, and set over medium heat. In a small bowl, mix together 1 1/2 tablespoons of  flour and water. When the milk begins to bubble, stir in the flour mixture, and cook stirring  constantly until thickened, 2 or 3 minutes. Let cool until set. You can put the mixture in the refrigerator to speed the process.",
        "Fold the eggs into the chilled dough. Add 1 cup of flour and mix thoroughly (dough will be lumpy). Drop into simmering soups by the teaspoonful. Simmer covered for 10 minutes, remove lid, and simmer 10 minutes more."
