        "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the baking soda, the salt, the ginger, and the cinnamon. In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the brown sugar and beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. In a small bowl whisk together the sour cream and the molasses. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture alternately with the molasses mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and beating the batter after each addition until it is just combined, and stir in the raisins. Divide the batter among 5 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2 inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Remove the breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month."
