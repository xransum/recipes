Add flour mixture gradually, beating until just combined. Press dough evenly into an 11-by 7-inch or a 9-inch square baking pan and with a sharp knife score about 1/4-inch deep in top 1- to 2-inch squares or rectangles. Bake shortbread in middle of oven 45 to 55 minutes, or until pale golden. Cool shortbread in pan on a rack and cut completely through score marks."
