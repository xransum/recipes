    "Whisk vinegar, sugar, salt, and 1 1/2 cups water in a large glass jar until sugar dissolves. Prick Hungarian wax peppers and Italian frying peppers all over with a cake tester or the point of a sharp paring knife (this helps the brine penetrate the chiles faster). Add both peppers and jalape単os to jar and chill at least 12 hours before using.",
    "Chiles can be pickled 2 weeks ahead. Keep chilled."
