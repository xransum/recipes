Sprinkle 1/3 of chopped olives over, then 1/4 of cheese. Top with 1/3 of fennel; sprinkle with salt and pepper and 1/3 of marjoram. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Repeat layering two more times. Top with remaining potatoes, then half of remaining cheese; dot with re-maining 1 tablespoon butter. Pour milk over; arrange halved olives atop. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover pan with foil.",
        "Bake gratin until vegetables are almost tender, about 50 minutes. Remove foil; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake uncovered until potatoes are tender and golden, about 25 minutes longer. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350\u00b0F oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.) Let gratin stand 15 minutes. Serve with Tomato-Marjoram Sauce."
