        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place the potatoes in a large pan, pour in the vegetable stock to cover, and boil until tender. Drain, keeping 3 tablespoons of stock, and return to the pan. Mash thoroughly with the stock, season well, and set aside to cool slightly.",
        "Meanwhile, gently cook the onions in the oil until soft but not colored. Add the mushrooms and cook until all the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the parsley and season well. Spoon the mixture into the base of a deep 2-quart baking dish.",
        "Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the potato mixture, beating in well. Whisk the egg whites until stiff and fold into the potato mixture. Pile the potatoes on top of the mushrooms and bake in the oven for 1 hour until golden brown on top. Serve with a large watercress, orange, and walnut salad."
