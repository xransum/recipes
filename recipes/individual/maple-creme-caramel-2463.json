        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Lightly butter four 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes or custard cups. Combine sugar and water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar melts. Increase heat; boil without stirring until deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into prepared dishes. Using oven mitts as aid, quickly rotate dishes to coat sides with some of caramel. Set aside.",
        "Whisk maple syrup, yolks and egg in medium bowl to blend. Combine cream and milk in heavy medium saucepan and bring to boil. Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture. Divide custard among prepared dishes. Set dishes into 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of dishes. Cover baking pan with foil.",
