        "Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and work in with a pastry blender or your fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal (the largest butter pieces should be no bigger than a pea).",
        "Make a well in the center of flour mixture and add egg and buttermilk to well. Gradually incorporate into dry ingredients, mixing from the center out, until a smooth batter forms. Add onion and jalape\u00f1o and mix gently just to evenly disperse (be careful not to overmix).",
        "Pour oil into a large heavy saucepan to come halfway up sides and fit with thermometer. Heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Using a 1-oz. scoop or a tablespoon and working in 2\u20133 batches, carefully drop balls of batter into oil and fry, turning often with a spider or a slotted spoon and adjusting heat to maintain temperature, until hushpuppies are puffed and deep golden all over, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and let cool slightly.",
        "Serve warm hushpuppies with tartar sauce alongside for dipping.",
        "Batter can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Scoop cold batter directly into hot oil and fry."
