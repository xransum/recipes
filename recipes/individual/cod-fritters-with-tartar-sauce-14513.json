In a large deep skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil to 350\u00b0F and in it fry the cod balls in batches for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the fritters with a slotted spoon as they are fried to paper towels to drain. Serve the fritters warm with the remaining tartar sauce."
