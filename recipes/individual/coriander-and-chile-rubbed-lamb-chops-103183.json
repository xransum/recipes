        "Divide lemon juice and garlic between 2 sealable plastic bags and put 6 tied chops in each bag, shaking to distribute marinade. Marinate 20 minutes. Grind coriander and red pepper flakes with a mortar and pestle or in an electric coffee/spice grinder, then pour onto a plate. Pat chops dry and season well with salt. Dip both sides of each chop into spice mixture to coat.",
        "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chops, 4 at a time, until browned on all sides (add more oil to skillet for each batch). Transfer chops to a large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan as browned.",
        "When all chops are browned, roast in middle of oven 10 minutes for medium-rare. Remove string before serving."
