Arrange tomato slices in one layer on cheese. Scatter onion slices and herbs over tomatoes and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Bake tarts in upper third of oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until crust is golden. Tarts may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered loosely. Reheat tarts before serving. Serve tarts warm or at room temperature."
