        "Remove saucepan from heat and immediately transfer to sink to halt cooking. Continue to stir custard until cooled; stir in vanilla extract.",
        "Pour custard into an ice cream maker once it reaches 40 degrees F (4 degrees C). Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer at least 2 hours to overnight."
