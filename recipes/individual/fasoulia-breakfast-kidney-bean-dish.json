Stir in the jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 5 more minutes. Mix in tomato and tomato paste; stir to combine with the onion and jalapeno pepper. Pour in the kidney beans with their liquid; stir in the cumin and curry powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the beans are hot and the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes."
