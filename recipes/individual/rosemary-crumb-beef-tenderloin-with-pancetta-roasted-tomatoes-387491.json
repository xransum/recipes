        "Spread top and upper part of sides with mustard mixture, then sprinkle evenly with bread crumbs. Pat lightly to adhere.",
        "Roast tenderloin until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of thickest part of meat registers 120\u00b0F, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer beef to a cutting board and let stand 15 minutes (internal temperature will rise to about 130\u00b0F for medium-rare).",
        "Set roasting pan over 2 burners and add remaining 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits, then stir in tomato mixture and parsley.",
