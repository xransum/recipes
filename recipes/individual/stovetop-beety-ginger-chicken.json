Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in the chicken. Cook and stir until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour the beets and the remaining liquid into the pan along with the mushrooms and onion. Continue cooking and stirring until the liquid has evaporated once again, about 5 minutes more."
