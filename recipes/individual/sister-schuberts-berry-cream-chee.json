        "Slice remaining layer into twelve even wedges. Set ten wedges aside for top of cake. Crumble two remaining wedges and add to bowl of crumbs; add butter and blend. Press crumb mixture into bottom of prepared pan in an even layer.",
        "In a bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar with a hand mixer until smooth. Add cornstarch and mix to incorporate. Add egg and vanilla and mix until just blended.

Gently press ten wedges into fruit and cream layer, leaving space into between each wedge. Pour remaining cream cheese mixture over wedges and spread evenly.",
