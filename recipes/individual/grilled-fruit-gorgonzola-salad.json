        "Brush a small amount of oil on the pineapple, peaches, and pear to prevent them from sticking to the grill.  Sprinkle all sides of the fruit with pepper.  Place the fruit flesh side down on the grill and cook for 10 minutes, turning as needed, until soft and caramelized.",
        "When the fruit is cooked, remove from the grill and place on a serving platter.  Sprinkle with crumbled cheese and top with chopped basil, parsley and arugula.  Drizzle with olive oil if desired.  Serve hot."
