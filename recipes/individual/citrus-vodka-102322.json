        "Fold 1 orange peel strip crosswise in half without breaking. Thread onto skewer, shish-kebab style. Repeat with 1 lemon peel strip, then 1 lime peel strip. Repeat, alternating remaining orange, lemon and lime peel strips on same skewer. Guide citrus peel skewer through neck of empty bottle, pushing gently but being careful not to break any peel. You may find a chopstick useful in easing the peels into the bottle. Fill bottle with vodka. Chill at least 1 week and up to 3 weeks. Serve chilled."
