        "In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the fennel for 15 minutes, or until it is barely tender. Transfer the fennel to a cutting board, let it cool, and cut it lengthwise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. In a large skillet heat the oil and the butter over moderately high heat until the butter is foaming and in the fat saut\u00e9 the fennel slices for 3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Sprinkle the fennel with the lemon juice, the coriander, and salt and pepper to taste, divide it between 2 plates, and garnish it with the reserved fennel leaves."
