With a spoon, remove the seeds and white membranes (the source of the heat; leave a little if you like things HOT). Smear cream cheese into each jalapeno half and then wrap with a bacon piece (1/2 slice). Secure by sticking a toothpick through the middle. Place on the rack in the baking sheet.",
        "Bake until the bacon is sizzling and done, 1 hour 15 minutes. Serve immediately, or they're also great at room temperature."
