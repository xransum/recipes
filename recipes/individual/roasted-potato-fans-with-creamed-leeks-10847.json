        "Trim leeks, discarding dark green part, and halve lengthwise. Cut leeks crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and in a large bowl of cold water wash well. Drain leeks.",
        "In a 12-inch heavy ovenproof skillet cook leeks and onions in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 15 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add broth in a stream, stirring, and simmer, stirring, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste and remove skillet from heat.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Peel potatoes and halve lengthwise. Arrange each potato flat side down and make crosswise slices about 1/4 inch apart, cutting down to about 1/4 inch from flat side but not all the way through (a metal skewer inserted lengthwise about 1/4 inch from flat side will prevent slicing all the way through). Remove skewer if using.",
        "Arrange potato halves, flat sides down, in leek mixture and bring mixture to a simmer. Brush potatoes with butter and sprinkle with paprika and salt and pepper to taste. Bake mixture in lower third of oven 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender within and crisp and golden on top."
