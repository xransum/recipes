        "Bake ham in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not touching bone, reads 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 2 hours.",
        "Combine brown sugar, whiskey, and black pepper in a bowl until glaze is smooth.",
        "Raise oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Baste ham with 1/3 the whiskey glaze. Return to oven and bake until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), basting ham with whiskey glaze every 10 minutes. Cover ham loosely with a tent of aluminum foil if ham browns too quickly.",
        "Let ham rest for 15 minutes before carving."
