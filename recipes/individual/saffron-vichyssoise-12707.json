        "In a heavy kettle cook the leek, the onion, the celery, the carrots, the thyme, the bay leaf, and salt and pepper to taste in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened. Add the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, the saffron, the wine, the broth, and the water and simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender. Discard the bay leaf and in a blender pur\u00e9e the soup in batches, transferring the soup as it is pur\u00e9ed to a large bowl. Stir in the half-and-half and salt and pepper to taste, let the soup cool, and chill it for at least 8 hours or overnight."
