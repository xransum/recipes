Grill bell pepper and scallions, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, and transfer to bowl. Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side, and transfer to bowl.",

Add bell pepper, scallions, shrimp, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste to corn and toss to combine. In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.",
