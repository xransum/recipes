        "Meanwhile, whisk flour, coarse salt, and baking powder in medium bowl. Add beer and vodka; whisk just until blended. Pour enough oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pot; heat oil over medium heat to 350\u00b0F. Working with 2 onion rings at a time, dip onion rings into batter; shake off excess. Gently drop onion rings into hot oil; fry until deep golden, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer onion rings to paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter and onion rings.",
