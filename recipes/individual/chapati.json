        "In a bowl, stir together the 1 1/2 cups flour and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the 1 Tbs. usli ghee and the milk. Add to the flour mixture and stir well. Add the 1/2 cup water and stir well, gathering and pressing, until the flour adheres together. If the dough looks dry, add 1 to 2 Tbs. more water, but do not add too much or the dough will become too sticky.",
        "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes. If necessary, add more flour or water to achieve a workable, elastic consistency. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each into a 1 1/2- to 2-inch ball and roll out into a 6-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick.",

        "griddle or cast-iron fry pan over medium-high heat. Brush the tava lightly with usli ghee. Place 1 dough round on the tava and cook until covered with light brown specks, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using tongs, turn the chapati over and cook for 30 seconds more. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining dough rounds.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a stovetop roaster over high heat. Place a browned chapati on the roaster and cook until it puffs up, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Brush the chapati with usli ghee and place in a shallow bowl lined with a kitchen towel or paper towels. Repeat with the remaining chapati. Serve warm. Makes 8."
