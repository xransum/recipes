Combine 7 tablespoons ice water and 2 1/2 teaspoons vinegar in small bowl; pour over flour mixture. Stir with fork until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if needed. Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces. Flatten each into disk. Wrap each separately in plastic; chill 20 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Mix all ingredients in large bowl; toss. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 1 inch. Spoon filling into dough-lined dish. Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.
