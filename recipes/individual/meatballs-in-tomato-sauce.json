        "To make the meatballs, in a large bowl, combine the ground meats, egg, onion, bread crumbs, pine nuts, cheese, parsley, oregano and basil. Season with the salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix gently but thoroughly. Form the mixture into meatballs about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter.",
        "To make the sauce, in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices and the wine and bring to a simmer. Lower the meatballs into the sauce, gently spooning the sauce over them. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the meatballs are firm and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the basil. Transfer the meatballs and tomato sauce to a large shallow bowl and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
