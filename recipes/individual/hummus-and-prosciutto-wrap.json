Place a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of the prosciutto, and spread 1/4 of the avocado slices per wrap on the cheese. Top each wrap with 1 sliced tomato and about 1/4 cup of torn lettuce leaves.",
        "Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the wrap tightly into a compact cylinder."
