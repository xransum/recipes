        "Add the bacon, carrots, onions and garlic to the saut\u00e9 pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker along with the bay leaves, thyme, parsley and mushrooms.",
        "Off the heat, pour the wine into the saut\u00e9 pan and set over medium-high heat. Whisk in the demi-glace and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Add to the slow cooker, cover and cook until the meat is fork tender, 6 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Discard the bay leaves.",
        "Transfer the beef bourguignonne to a platter and serve with steamed potatoes. Serves 10."
