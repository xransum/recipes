        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.",
        "Stir the garlic, ricotta, and basil in a saucepan over medium-low until hot, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir in the spaghetti and reserved water from cooking the pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve."
