        "Stir the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined (don't fret if the batter has lumps).",
        "Grease a small 1 1/4-inch ice-cream scoop with nonstick spray and fill the liners about 3/4 of the way to the top. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar, if using.",
        "Bake until a toothpick inserted in the muffins comes out clean and the tops spring back when touched, 14 to 16 minutes. Rotate the trays front to back and top to bottom about halfway through baking to ensure even baking. Let the muffins rest in the hot muffin pan 3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack and let cool 30 minutes."
