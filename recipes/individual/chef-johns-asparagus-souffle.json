        "Cook asparagus in a saucepan of boiling water until bright green but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer asparagus to ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.",
        "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 2 minutes.",
        "Whisk milk into butter-flour mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne pepper.",
        "Place milk mixture, garlic, and asparagus in a blender and puree until smooth.",
        "Pour asparagus mixture into a large bowl; stir in egg yolks and Cheddar cheese.",
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Generously butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins",
        "Beat egg whites in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak",
        "Stir half of egg whites into asparagus cheese mixture until just combined. Gently fold remaining egg whites into mixture.",
        "Fill prepared ramekins about 3/4 full and place on a baking sheet; bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes"
