    "Grill the salmon, skinned sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals or in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat for 5 minutes, turn it, and grill it for 3 minutes more, or until it is just cooked through. Arrange 4 of the radicchio leaves on each of 8 heated plates, put a piece of salmon in the center, and top it with some of the salsa."
