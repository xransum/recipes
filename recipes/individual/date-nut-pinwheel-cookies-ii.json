    "Cream the butter and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Sift the cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and flour together in a second mixing bowl. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture until evenly blended.",
    "Divide the dough evenly into three portions and place each on a square of waxed paper. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.",
    "Meanwhile, make the filling by combine the dates, pecans, water and white sugar in a saucepan set over low heat.  Cook and stir until the filling has a paste-like consistency. Cool slightly.",
    "Working with one portion at a time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to make a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread 1/3 of the filling evenly over the dough; roll up to make a log.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.",
