        "Saut\u00e9 the ingredients",
        "In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the pancetta and saut\u00e9 until it begins to render its fat, about 1 minute. Add the onions, carrots and celery and saut\u00e9 until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer red, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker.",
        "Add the broth and wine to the pan and increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Pour the liquid into the slow cooker along with the tomatoes and stir to combine.",
        "Cook the sauce",
        "Cover and cook the sauce on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Add the milk, stirring to combine. Cover and continue cooking for 20 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Cook the pasta",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the 2 Tbs. salt and the pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, according to the package instructions until al dente (tender but firm to the bite). Drain, return the pasta to the pot and toss gently with 2 cups of the sauce. Serve, passing the cheese at the table. Serves 4; makes about 12 cups sauce total.",
