        "Preheat an oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "In a large bowl, lightly whisk together the eggs, cheese, milk, salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "In a 10- or 12-inch ovenproof fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Remove the sausages from their casings, add the meat to the pan and cook, stirring constantly and breaking up the meat into 1-inch pieces, until nicely browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the arugula and stir just until evenly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sausage mixture to the bowl with the egg mixture.",
        "Wipe the pan clean and return it to medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil and spread to coat the pan bottom. When the oil is hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan and smooth the top. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, for 1 minute.",
        "Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the frittata is set in the center and slightly puffed, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan. Carefully run a paring knife or sharp-bladed spatula around the inside edges to release the frittata and slide onto a large plate. Cut the frittata into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Serves 8.",
