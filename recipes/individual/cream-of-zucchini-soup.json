        "Heat the olive oil and margarine together in a large pot; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil and margarine until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the zucchini and season with the oregano, salt, and pepper; continue cooking and stirring until the zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes.",
        "Pour the water into the pot, and stir in the bouillon powder. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer another 10 minutes. Add the Gorgonzola cheese and allow it to melt into the soup.",
        "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Secure the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the cooking pot. Stir the creamer through the soup before serving hot."
