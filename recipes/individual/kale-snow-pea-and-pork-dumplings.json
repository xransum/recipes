        "Place the kale, snow pea, water chestnut, cilantro, chive, ginger, mirin, oil, pork, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and mix well to combine. Place the wrappers on a clean work surface and brush the edges with water. Place 1 teaspoon of the kale mixture in the center of each wrapper. Fold the edges of the wrappers over and press together to seal. Place a steamer lined with non-stick baking paper over a saucepan of simmering water. Steam the dumplings, in batches, for 10\u201312 minutes or until cooked through. Top with the onion and serve with chili sauce and black vinegar."
