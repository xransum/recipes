        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Blanch broccoli rabe for 1 minute, then remove with tongs, and rinse with cold water to cool. Add pasta to the boiling water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.",
        "Meanwhile, brown the sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the sausage has nearly cooked through, drain the excess grease, and stir in garlic and shallot. Cook until the shallots soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli rabe, artichokes and roasted peppers, cook for 1 to 2 minutes to warm. Stir in the hot pasta along with Parmesan cheese, and enough pasta water to moisten."
