        "Using tweezers, remove any bones from sea bass. Trim spongy root ends from mushrooms. Have ready a shallow baking pan lined with paper towels. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until it just begins to smoke and saut\u00e9 fillets, skin sides down, pressing gently with a spatula if fillets curl, until skin is golden, about 3 minutes. Turn fillets over and saut\u00e9 2 minutes more, or until almost cooked through. Add reserved (uncooked) soy sauce mixture to fish and simmer until fish is just cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer fillets, skin sides down, with a slotted spatula to baking pan to drain and add mushrooms to liquid remaining in skillet. Cook mushrooms, stirring frequently, until tender, about 1 minute, and remove skillet from heat.",
