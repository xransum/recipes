  "directions": [
    "Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Combine garlic, parsley, red pepper flakes, and 4 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl.",
    "Working one at a time, use kitchen shears to cut along the length of the back of each prawn just deep enough into flesh to expose vein; remove. Toss prawns with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in another medium bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper.",
    "Grill prawns, turning occasionally, until shells are bright red and meat is cooked through (it will look slightly opaque), about 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl with garlic-parsley mixture and toss to coat; season with kosher salt and pepper. Transfer prawns to a serving platter and pour garlic-parsley mixture over; sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
