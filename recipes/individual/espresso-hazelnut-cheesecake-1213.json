        "Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth. Add sugar and beat until well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until blended and scraping down sides of bowl after each addition. Beat in sour cream and 1/2 cup cream. Stir espresso powder and 2 tablespoons warm water in small bowl until powder dissolves. Add to filling and beat until blended. Beat in vanilla. Stir in nuts.",
        "Pour filling into prepared pan. Place pan in large baking pan. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of springform pan. Bake cake until top is puffed and center is almost set, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn off oven; open door slightly. Let cake stand in oven with door ajar 1 hour. Remove pan from water; transfer to rack. Cool. Wrap in foil and chill overnight. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled).",
