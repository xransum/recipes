    "In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream and salt until well combined.",
    "In a 9 1/2-inch (24-cm) sauté pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the green onions and sauté until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ham and peas and cook for 1 minute, then pour the egg mixture into the pan. Divide the goat cheese into tablespoon-size pieces and sprinkle on top of the egg mixture.",
