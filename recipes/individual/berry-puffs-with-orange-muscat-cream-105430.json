        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
        "Unfold pastry sheet, then turn over (to prevent creases from splitting during baking). Cut 6 (4 1/2-inch) triangles from sheet with a long sharp knife and a ruler.",
        "Arrange triangles on a greased baking sheet and lightly prick centers a few times with a fork. Bake in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool.",
        "Stir together cornstarch, water, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Add berries and sugar and simmer over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up berries, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Force pur\u00e9e through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids, then cool pur\u00e9e at room temperature.",
        "Boil wine in another small saucepan until reduced to about 1 tablespoon, 10 to 12 minutes, then cool.",
        "Beat cream with confectioners sugar and zest in a bowl until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold wine into cream until just incorporated, then chill.",
        "Split each pastry triangle in half horizontally and make a sandwich with about 1 1/2 tablespoons cream. Spread 1 teaspoon pur\u00e9e on top of each pastry, leaving a 1/4-inch border (there will be pur\u00e9e left over). Decoratively arrange some raspberries and blackberries on top and sift some confectioners sugar over berries."
