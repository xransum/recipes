    "directions": [
        "In a small saucepan heat milk with sugar, butter, and salt over low heat until mixture is lukewarm, or registers between 110\u00b0F. and 115\u00b0F. on a candy thermometer, and transfer to a bowl.",
        "Sprinkle yeast over milk mixture and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg and stir in 2 1/2 cups flour, stirring until mixture forms a dough.",
        "On a floured surface knead dough, kneading in enough of remaining 1/2 cup flour to form a soft dough, 8 to 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball and transfer to a well-buttered bowl. Turn dough to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.",
        "Butter 32 miniature (1/8-cup) muffin tins. Turn dough out on a floured surface. Working with about one third of dough at a time, cut off pieces about the size of large marbles. Form pieces into balls and put 3 balls into each tin. Let rolls rise, covered loosely, in a warm place until almost doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes.",
        "While rolls are rising, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Brush rolls lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with seeds. Bake rolls in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen, double-wrapped in resealable plastic bags, with excess air pressed out. Reheat rolls, wrapped in foil, in middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until heated through."
