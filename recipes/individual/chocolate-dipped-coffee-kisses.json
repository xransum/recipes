        "Beat egg whites, coffee granules, vanilla extract, cream of tartar, and salt with an electric mixer at high speed until soft peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating constantly, until stiff but still glossy peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Drop egg white mixture by rounded tablespoons 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet (alternately, fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip with egg white mixture and pipe out 1- to 1 1/2-inch stars).",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until kisses are firm and dry, about 2 hours. Cool on the baking sheet set on a wire rack for 1 hour.",
        "Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and cool slightly.",
        "Peel kisses from parchment paper. Dip the base of each kiss in melted chocolate and transfer to waxed paper-lined plate. Freeze kisses until chocolate hardens, 2 to 3 minutes."
