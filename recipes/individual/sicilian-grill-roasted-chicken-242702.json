        "Prepare barbecue ( medium heat). If using 2-burner gas grill, light 1 burner. If using 3-burner gas grill, do not light center burner. If using charcoal grill, light briquettes in chimney and pour onto 1 side of lower grill rack (you'll need to light more briquettes in chimney to replenish during grilling). Remove chickens from marinade.",
        "Sprinkle chickens inside and out with salt and pepper. Tie legs together. Place chickens, breast side down, over unlit side of grill. Cover and grill chickens 45 minutes, adjusting gas levels if using gas grill or adjusting vents and adding more charcoal as needed if using charcoal grill to maintain barbecue temperature between 350\u00b0F and 400\u00b0F. Turn chickens breast side up. Cover and grill until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0F., continuing to maintain barbecue temperature between 350\u00b0F and 400\u00b0F, about 35 minutes longer. Transfer chickens to work surface; let rest 10 minutes.",
