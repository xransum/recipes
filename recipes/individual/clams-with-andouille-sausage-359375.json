Saut\u00e9 until sausage browns and vegetables begin to soften, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Add clams, Sherry, and cream. Cover pot and cook over medium-high heat until clams open, 5 to 6 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and Sherry wine vinegar. Season juices to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and serve. Adapted from Elliot's Oyster House.",
