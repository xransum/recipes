        "In a food processor blend together the flour, the salt, the butter, and the shortening until the mixture resembles meal and transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the water, toss the mixture until the water is incorporated, adding as much of the remaining 2 tablespoons water as necessary to form a dough, and form the dough into a ball. Dust the dough with flour and chill it, wrapped in wax paper, for 1 hour. Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface and fit it into a 9 1/2-inch (1 1/2-quart) deep-fish pie plate. Crimp the edge of the dough decoratively and chill the shell for 3 minutes.",
        "In a bowl whisk together the syrup, the butter, the cinnamon, the maple extract, the flour, the eggs, the grated zest, the juice, and the salt until the filling is smooth and stir in the walnuts.",
        "Pour the filling into the shell and bake the pie in the lower third of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F., bake the pie for 30 minutes more, or until it is golden and just set, and transfer it to a rack. Let the pie cool, garnish it with the orange zest strip, and serve it with the whipped cream."
