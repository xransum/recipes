        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter three 8- by 2-inch round cake pans and line bottoms with rounds of wax paper. Butter paper and dust with flour, knocking out excess flour.",
        "Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a glass measure stir together milk, water, and vanilla. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat butter on medium speed 1 minute. Gradually beat in sugar and beat mixture until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. With mixer on low speed add flour and milk mixtures alternately in 4 batches, beginning and ending with milk mixture, and beat until just combined (mixture will look curdled; do not overbeat).",
        "Divide batter evenly among pans (about 3 scant cups per pan), smoothing tops and tapping pans on counter to allow any air bubbles to escape. Bake layers in middle and lower thirds of oven (arrange pans so they overlap only slightly) until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert layers onto racks. Carefully remove wax paper and cool layers completely. Cake layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept, wrapped in plastic wrap, in an airtight container in a cool dry place. (Alternatively, layers may be made 3 days ahead and frozen, wrapped in plastic wrap and foil. Thaw layers in refrigerator 1 day before proceeding.)",
        "With a knife halve vanilla bean lengthwise. Scrape seeds into a 3-quart saucepan and stir in pod and remaining filling ingredients. Bring mixture just to a boil and cook at a bare simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Discard pod and transfer filling to a bowl. Cool filling completely. Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring filling to room temperature before proceeding.",
        "With a long serrated knife horizontally halve cake layers. Arrange 1 cake half, cut side up, on a cake plate and spread evenly with about 1/2 cup filling. Repeat layering in same manner with remaining cake halves and filling, ending with a cake half, cut side down.",
        "In a 3-quart metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water whisk together frosting ingredients until mixture is warm and sugar is dissolved. With a hand-held electric mixer on high speed beat frosting about 6 minutes, or until thick and fluffy. (Depending on mixer and weather, this may take longer.) Remove bowl from heat and beat frosting until cool and spreadable. Frost cake and coat with coconut. Cake keeps, covered, 2 days."
