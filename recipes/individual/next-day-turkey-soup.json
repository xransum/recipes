        "In a large soup pot, heat garlic in the olive oil. Allow to brown slightly and add onion, carrot and celery. Cover; sweat over medium-low heat until softened, 7 or 8 minutes. Add the chopped sage to the soup pot along with the broth and the bay leaf. Bring to a simmer. When simmering, add the green beans, sweet potato and pasta to the soup. Bring it back up to a simmer; lower heat and cook for about 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender and pasta is cooked. Stir in turkey. Turn the heat off. Cover, and allow to sit and steam for 5 to 7 minutes."
