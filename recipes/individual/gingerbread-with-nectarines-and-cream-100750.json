        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour. Into a bowl sift together flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and salt. In a cup beat egg lightly and stir into flour mixture with sugar, molasses, and oil. Add boiling water in a slow stream, whisking until combined well, and pour batter into pan. Bake gingerbread in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean.",
        "Cut nectarines into 1/4-inch-thick wedges and in a bowl toss with 1 tablespoon sugar. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat cream with vanilla and remaining teaspoon sugar until it holds soft peaks.",
        "Cool gingerbread slightly in pan on a rack. Cut gingerbread into quarters and put 1 quarter on each of 2 plates. Top gingerbread with nectarines and whipped cream. Remaining gingerbread keeps, wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen, 2 weeks."
