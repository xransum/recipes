        "In a heavy skillet combine the sugar and the water, cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring and washing down the sugar crystals with a brush dipped in cold water until the sugar is dissolved, and simmer it, undisturbed, tilting and rotating the skillet, until it is a deep caramel color. Stir in the pumpkin seeds, stirring until they are coated well, and turn the mixture out onto a buttered sheet of foil, spreading it evenly. Let the brittle cool completely and break it into pieces.",
        "In a bowl toss the seeds with the oil and salt to taste and on an ungreased baking sheet bake them in the middle of a preheated 250\u00b0F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour to 1 1/4 hours, or until they are golden and crisp. (Alternatively the prepared seeds may be spread in a microwave-safe glass baking dish, microwaved at high power (100%), stirring after every minute, for 4 minutes, and microwaved at medium power (50%), stirring after every 2 minutes, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are crisp.) Makes 1/2 cups."
