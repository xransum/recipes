        "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions in the heated oil until clear, but not brown. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, and basil;  bring to a boil.  Stir in rice and return to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer until the liquid is completely absorbed into the rice, about 20 minutes."
