        "In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
        "In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade, combine the flour and salt and process with 3 or 4 pulses. With the motor running on the dough speed, slowly add the yeast mixture, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. Continue processing until the dough forms a ball and cleans the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute, then process for 1 minute more.",
        "Coat the inside of a large bowl with the olive oil and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1\u20442 hours. Divide the dough in half and roll out as directed in the pizza recipe."
