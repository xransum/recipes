        "Separate garlic head into cloves, discarding loose papery outer skin but keeping skin intact on cloves, and wrap in foil, crimping seams to seal tightly. Roast garlic in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until soft. Unwrap garlic and cool slightly. Peel skins from each clove and in a bowl with a fork mash garlic pulp until smooth.",
        "Rinse and drain enough beans to measure 1 cup, reserving remainder for another use, and add to garlic. Cut 2 tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and add to beans. Quarter remaining tomato and in a blender or food processor puree until smooth. Add puree to bean mixture. Finely chop onion and basil and add to bean mixture with lemon juice, tossing to combine. Season salsa with salt and pepper. Salsa may be made 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered."
