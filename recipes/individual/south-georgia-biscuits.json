        "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or by rubbing between your fingers until the lumps are smaller than peas. Pour in the milk all at once, and stir with a large spoon until dough is evenly moist. It should be sticky.",
        "Flour your hands, and knead the dough lightly for 3 or 4 turns, adding just enough flour so that it doesn't stick to your hands. Let the dough rest for a minute or two.",
        "With well-floured hands, pinch off pieces of dough (about 12) and pat lightly into balls. Don't over work the dough. Place about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. With floured knuckles, press each ball down to about 1/2 inch thickness.",
        "Bake for 11 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned on the bottom. Serve hot with butter."
