        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12 inch baking dish. Place flour in a shallow dish. Dredge steaks in the flour to coat evenly.",
        "Heat peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the steaks for about 5 to 8 minutes per side, until golden brown.",
        "Place 3 fried cube steaks in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the steaks lightly with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper, and scatter 1/3 cup of diced onions over the steaks. Layer the remaining 3 steaks on top, repeat the seasoning, and sprinkle with the rest of the onion.",
