        "Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic briefly in the butter mixture, about 1 minute. Stir corn into butter and oil to coat; cook and stir until warmed, about 3 minutes. Pour milk into the skillet; bring to a simmer. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes.",
