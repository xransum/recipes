        "In a bowl combine well 1/4 cup water, the garlic, the jalape\u00f1o, the soy sauce, the orange juice, the sugar, and the salt, add the scallops, coating them well with the marinade, and chill the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain the scallops well. In a heavy skillet, preferably non-stick, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saut\u00e9 the scallops in batches, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are golden brown, transferring them as they are cooked to a plate and adding more of the oil to the skillet if necessary. Arrange a scallop on each cucumber slice and garnish it with a coriander leaf."
