        "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Lightly grease two baking sheets.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the sugar, salt, oil and 1 cup of flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.",
        "Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds on prepared baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.",
