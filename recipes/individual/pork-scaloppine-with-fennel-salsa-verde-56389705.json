        "Stir fennel, fennel fronds, shallot, garlic, capers, parsley, lemon zest, and 1/3 cup olive oil in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Cover salsa verde and let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, grind fennel seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Slice pork loin into 4 pieces. Use the tip of a sharp knife to lightly score both sides of each piece in a crosshatch pattern, being careful to barely break the surface. Lightly brush all over with olive oil. Working one at a time, pound pork between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to 1/4\" thick. Sprinkle with ground fennel, pressing to adhere; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Working one at a time and adding more vegetable oil to skillet between batches as needed, cook pork until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plates.",
        "Cook lemon halves, cut side down, in skillet until browned and caramelized, about 2 minutes. Spoon salsa verde over scaloppine and squeeze with lemons.",
        "Salsa verde can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill."
