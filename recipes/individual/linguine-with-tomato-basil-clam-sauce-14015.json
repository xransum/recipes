        "In a 6-quart kettle bring 4 quarts salted water to a boil and cook linguine until al dente. Drain linguine in a colander.",
        "While linguine is cooking, with a small knife remove meat from the largest 24 clams, discarding shells, and in a food processor pulse just until chopped coarse. Into reserved clam liquid stir chopped clams, tomatoes, garlic, oil, and red pepper flakes and simmer 2 minutes. Add linguine, basil, remaining 12 clams in their shells, and any liquid in bowl and toss well with salt and pepper to taste."
