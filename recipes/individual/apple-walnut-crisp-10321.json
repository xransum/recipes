        "In a bowl stir together well the flour, the oats, the brown sugar, the cinnamon, and the salt. Add the butter, blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal, and stir in the walnuts. In a large bowl toss the apples with the lemon juice and the granulated sugar and transfer the mixture to a buttered 10-inch (2 quart) pie plate. Crumble the topping evenly over the apple mixture and bake the crisp in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the apples are cooked through and the top is golden. Let the crisp stand for 10 minutes and serve it warm with the whipped cream."
