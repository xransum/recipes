        "Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken on both sides with pepper; cook the chicken breasts in the butter until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 7 minutes each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the breasts from the pan and set aside.",
        "Stir together the onion, parsley, applesauce, wine, mustard, and half-and-half in the pan; bring the mixture to a boil and cook about 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan; add the walnuts. Allow to cook until the chicken is warm, 3 to 5 minutes."
