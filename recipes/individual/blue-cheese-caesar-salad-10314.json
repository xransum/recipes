        "In a jelly-roll pan toss the bread cubes with 1 tablespoon of the oil and salt to taste, bake them in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden, and let the croutons cool. In a small bowl stir together well the garlic paste, the anchovy, and half the blue cheese, whisk in the lemon juice and the Worcestershire sauce, whisking until the mixture is smooth, and whisk in the remaining oil and salt and pepper to taste, whisking until the dressing is combined well. In a saucepan of boiling water boil the egg in the shell for 30 seconds and drain it. In a salad bowl toss the romaine with the dressing. Break the egg into the greens, add the Parmesan, the remaining blue cheese, and the croutons, and toss the salad until it is combined well."
