        "Beat the margarine and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the sour cream, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves.  Pour in the corn muffin mix alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the cream-style corn and sweet corn; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pan.",
