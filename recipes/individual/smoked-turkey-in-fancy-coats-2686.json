Cover with second sheet of phyllo and brush with butter. Place 1 turkey slice 3 inches in from short end of sheet. Spread generous 1/3 cup ricotta filling over turkey. Fold bottom of phyllo over turkey, then roll twice. Fold in long sides of phyllo. Continue to roll up pastry, enclosing filling completely. Brush packet with butter. Arrange seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo, butter, turkey slices and ricotta filling, making 6 packets total. (Packets can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Bake turkey packets until golden and crisp, about 30 minutes."
