        "Heat butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir giblets and onion until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water to onion mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until liquid is reduced by 1/3 and meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring cup to measure 4 cups. Add more water if needed to make 4 cups.",

        "Pour drippings into a fat separator or a small bowl and allow fat to rise to the top; skim off excess fat and transfer to a 1-cup measuring cup. Fat should equal 3/4 cup; add butter if needed to get to 3/4 cup fat. Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-cup measuring cup, adding more water to equal 2 cups if needed.",
        "Combine the 2 cups drippings liquid and 4 cups broth in a bowl and cool.",

Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until gravy is thickened about 15 minutes. Season gravy with salt and pepper."
