        "Scoop the flesh from the figs with a spoon and discard the peels. Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Stir in fig pulp, lime juice, cinnamon, ginger, and white pepper. Cook, stirring often, until a candy thermometer reads 210 degrees F (100 degrees C), about 20 minutes.",
