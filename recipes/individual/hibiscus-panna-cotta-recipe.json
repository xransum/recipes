        "In a small saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil over high heat. Turn off the heat and add the tea bags. Allow the tea to sit for 10 minutes.",
        "Place the milk in a 2-quart saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes to soften the gelatin. Stir over medium heat just until the gelatin dissolves but the milk does not boil, about 5 minutes.",
        "Place a sieve over the saucepan and strain the tea mixture into the milk mixture, pressing lightly on the tea bags to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the tea bags. Stir in the cream, sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and cool slightly. Pour into 6 martini glasses or 5-ounce ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours.",
        "Garnish with fresh raspberries and serve."
