        "Place a roasting pan in oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Cut shoulder into four 1\"-thick steaks; season with salt. Whisk ginger, garlic, 1 Tbsp. vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. soy sauce in a small bowl. Set both aside.",
        "Remove stalk from broccoli. Peel, trim, and slice into 1/4\"-thick planks. Divide broccoli into large florets. Blanch stems and florets in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until bright green, about 10 seconds. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet; let cool. Pat dry and toss in a medium bowl with shallots, olive oil, and sesame seeds; season with salt.",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook reserved pork, undisturbed, until deep golden brown underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0F\u2013140\u00b0F for medium, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.",
        "Pour off fat from skillet and cook pineapple, tossing often and adding a splash or so of water if needed to keep mixture saucy, until slightly softened and browned in spots, about 3 minutes. Add 1 Tbsp. butter along with any pork juices on cutting board; toss until sauce is glossy and emulsified. Stir in remaining 2 tsp. vinegar and soy sauce. Season with salt.",
        "Meanwhile, transfer broccoli mixture to hot roasting pan. Roast until lightly browned but still crisp-tender, 8\u201310 minutes. Add to reserved dressing and toss to coat; season with salt. Serve pork with pineapple and broccoli."
