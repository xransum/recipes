        "2. Place the broth and oregano in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil; reserve.",
        "3. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Place pasta in the bottom of a 10- to 12-cup covered casserole. Spoon reserved sausage and greens over pasta. Scatter rice and barley over greens.

Remove from oven, add parsley and stir well. Serve immediately with cheese, if desired."
