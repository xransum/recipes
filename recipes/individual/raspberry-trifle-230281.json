        "Stir milk, sugar, cornstarch, and zest in a saucepan. Bring mixture almost to a boil over medium heat. Beat eggs in blender on low speed and slowly add hot milk mixture. Return to pan. Cook over low heat (do not boil), stirring constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 7 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Cool in refrigerator, stirring once. To assemble, place a layer of ladyfinger halves in the bottom of a glass serving bowl. Sprinkle with a little port. Spread 1/3 berries and 1/3 custard on top. Continue layering, ending with custard. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 1 hour."
