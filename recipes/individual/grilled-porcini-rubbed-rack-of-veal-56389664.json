        "Prepare grill for medium\u2013high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Coarsely grind red pepper flakes in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Combine ground red pepper flakes, porcini powder, sugar, kosher salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.",

        "Grill veal over direct heat, turning occasionally, until deeply browned all over, 15\u201320 minutes total. Move veal to indirect heat, placing bone side down, and grill, turning every 20 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of loin registers 115\u00b0, 1 1/2\u20132 hours. (Check after 30 minutes\u2014once thermometer registers 100\u00b0, the temperature will climb much faster.)",
        "Transfer veal to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Cut loin from the bones in one piece. Slice between bones to separate and grill over direct heat, turning often, until crisped and well charred, about 5 minutes.",
        "Grill loin over direct heat, cut side up, just to reheat slightly (do not grill the cut side), about 4 minutes. Slice loin 1/2\" thick and transfer to a platter. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve with bones alongside.",
