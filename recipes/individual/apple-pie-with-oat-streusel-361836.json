        "Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 400\u00b0F. Place rimmed baking sheet in bottom of oven to catch spills. Place sheet of parchment paper on work surface; lightly flour parchment. Place dough disk on parchment; sprinkle very lightly with flour. Cover with another sheet of parchment; roll to 9-inch round. Remove top parchment; sprinkle oats evenly over crust. Cover again with top parchment; roll to 12-inch round, rolling oats into crust. Remove top parchment. Using bottom parchment as aid, invert crust, oat side down, into 9-inchdiameter glass pie dish. Remove parchment. Press crust gently into pie dish. Turn dough overhang under, forming high-standing rim 1/2 inch above sides of dish. Crimp edges.",
        "Toss all ingredients in large bowl. Let stand while preparing topping.",
        "Blend first 6 ingredients in processor. Add butter; using on/off turns, blend until moist dough forms (mixture will resemble wet sand). Add oats; using on/off turns, mix briefly, leaving half of oats whole. Stir filling; transfer to crust, mounding in center. Sprinkle topping evenly over.",
        "Bake pie until topping is golden, about 40 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Bake until apples are tender when pierced with small sharp knife, covering pie loosely with foil if topping and crust are browning too quickly, about 1 hour longer. Cool pie on rack until slightly warm, at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature."
