        "In a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the ground beef and saut\u00e9, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the taco starter, reduce the heat to medium-low and bring to a gentle simmer. Continue cooking until the meat is cooked through and the sauce is thickened, about 8 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cover to keep warm.",
        "Toast the tortillas over a gas flame or on a griddle just until they give off the fragrance of toasted corn, about 20 seconds per side. Wrap the tortillas in foil to keep warm.",
        "To serve, place the beef mixture and warmed tortillas on the table and allow diners to assemble their own tacos, passing bowls with the pico de gallo, cheese, chiles, cilantro and lime wedges alongside. Serves 4 to 6.",
