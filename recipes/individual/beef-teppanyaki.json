    "Place a Himalayan salt plate on a grill and preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Slowly preheat the salt plate over a period of 45 minutes according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The internal grill temperature should be 450° to 500°F.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, the 1 1/2 Tbs. canola oil, the garlic, ginger, sugar and green onions. Add the beef, red onion and jalapeño and toss until well combined.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "Lightly brush the preheated salt plate with canola oil. Working in batches, place the beef mixture on the salt plate in a single layer and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the beef to a warmed serving dish. Brush the salt plate with more canola oil between batches. Serve the beef immediately. Serves 4.",
