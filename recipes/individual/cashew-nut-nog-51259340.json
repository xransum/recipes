        "Remove spice bundle; discard. Blend nut mixture 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve lined with a layer of cheesecloth into a large pitcher, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Whisk coconut milk, agave, and vanilla into nut milk. Cover and chill until cold, at least 3 hours.",
