        "Beat the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour, and milk with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the cream cheese mixture until completely blended, then beat in the last egg.  Mix in the instant pudding mix until just incorporated. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese filling into each muffin cup. Return muffin cups to the oven and bake until the filling is set, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 30 minutes then remove the desserts.",
