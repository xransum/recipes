        "In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon and baking soda.  Add oil, beaten eggs, food coloring; mix well. Drain the strawberries and reserve 1/2 cup of the juice for the filling. Fold in the drained strawberries. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pans.",
        "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.",
        "In a medium mixing bowl, mix together the cream cheese with 1/2 cup of the reserved strawberry juice. Slice the loaf twice horizontally to make three layers. Spread the cream cheese mixture between the layers and reassemble the loaf. Wrap loaves in plastic and chill in the refrigerator to set the filling. Slice and serve chilled."
