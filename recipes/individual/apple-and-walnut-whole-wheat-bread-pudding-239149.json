        "1. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F and grease a 9- by 12-inch baking pan.",
        "2. On a large cookie sheet, spread the bread cubes in an even layer. Bake until lightly toasted, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",
        "3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, eggs, yolks, and vanilla.",
        "4. In a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan, bring the milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg to a simmer. Remove from heat immediately. Whisking constantly, slowly add the hot milk to the egg mixture. Let the custard cool slightly.",
        "5. In a large bowl, combine the bread cubes, apple, and walnuts. Gently stir in the custard, coating the bread mixture thoroughly with the liquid. Let stand, tossing once or twice to distribute, until the custard is mostly absorbed, about 10 minutes.",
        "6. Spread the pudding evenly into the baking pan. Bake until it is brown and the edges are bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool, then slice and serve warm, topped with vanilla ice cream."
