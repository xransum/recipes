In a large bowl, combine the lamb, coriander, cumin, garlic, oregano, mint, some salt and pepper, and the soaked breadcrumbs. Mix well, but do not overwork. Fold in the feta, then form the mixture into eight 2-inch meatballs.",

        "To assemble the sliders: Load a meatball onto each bun. Top with tomato slices and some tzatziki. Secure the sliders with bamboo skewers. Serve on a large platter with extra tzatziki on the side."
