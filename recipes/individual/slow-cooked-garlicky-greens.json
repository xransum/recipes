        "Working in batches, cook greens in a large pot of boiling heavily salted water until just barely wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain; let cool, then squeeze out excess water with your hands. Coarsely chop; set aside.",
        "Heat a clean large pot over medium. Cook garlic and 1/2 cup oil, smashing down on garlic with a wooden spoon, until golden and soft, about 4 minutes. Add chiles de \u00e1rbol and cook 30 seconds to infuse the oil with chile. Reduce heat to medium-low; add reserved greens. Cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until greens are deep green and tender, 20\u201330 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer greens to a platter and drizzle with more oil."
