  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 275Â°. Peel and core pears and fill the cavities with raisins. Mix honey with water and pour into a baking dish just large enough to accomodate the pears in a single layer. Pour in half the sugar in an even layer, arrange pears on the sugar and cover with remaining sugar. Bake for 3 hours, turning the fruit occasionally, until the pears and syrup are caramel colored. Ladle into hot, sterilized preserving jars, cover and seal."
