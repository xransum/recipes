        "Season the brisket generously on both sides with salt and pepper. In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the oil until almost smoking. Add the brisket and brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Place the brisket, fat side up, in a 9-by-13-inch stainless-steel baking pan or disposable aluminum pan. Pour 1 2/3 cups of the barbecue sauce over the meat.",
        "Place the pan with the brisket on an electric smoker rack and fill the wood chip tray. Close the door and turn the smoker to 250\u00b0F according to the manufacturer's instructions. Smoke the brisket until cooked through and fork-tender, 8 to 9 hours, turning the brisket every 3 hours. During the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking, carefully arrange the corn on the remaining smoker racks and smoke for 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Remove the corn from the smoker. Transfer the brisket to a carving board and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Slice the brisket against the grain and arrange on a warmed platter. Pour the remaining barbecue sauce over the brisket. Serve immediately with the corn, allowing diners to shuck their own. Serves 8."
