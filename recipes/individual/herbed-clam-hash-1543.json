    "Sauté chopped bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until fat begins to be rendered, about 2 minutes. Add potatoes and sauté until beginning to soften and brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper. Sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Mix in drained clams and thyme. Cover skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until all vegetables are tender and hash is cooked through, occasionally using spatula to turn hash over in sections, about 10 minutes. Uncover, mix in parsley and cook hash 5 minutes longer to crisp, occasionally pressing to compact. Season hash to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
