        "Have the fish steaks ready in a baking dish large enough to hold them all in one layer.",
        "Set the herb mixture over medium-low heat and warm until it is very hot, but not boiling. Taste and adjust the seasoning. When it is the way you want it, pour the warm marinade over the fish steaks. Cover with plastic and set aside for an hour or so.",

        "Remove the plastic wrap and transfer the fish with their marinade to the oven. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the fish is done, basting every 5 minutes or so with the marinade.",
        "Serve immediately, spooning a little of the marinade over each serving."
