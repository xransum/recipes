        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast hazelnuts on a large rimmed baking sheet until skins are slightly darkened and split, 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool, then bundle in a kitchen towel and rub vigorously to remove skins (there will definitely be some stubborn pieces that refuse to come off\u2014do what you can). Transfer to a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Whisk hazelnuts, powdered sugar, buckwheat flour, and salt in a medium bowl to combine.",
        "Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it foams, then browns (be careful not to let it burn), 5\u20137 minutes. Let cool slightly.",
        "Whisk egg whites in a medium bowl until foamy (you\u2019re not trying to create volume; you just want to break them up), then whisk into dry ingredients. Whisk in brown butter. Cover and chill batter until firm, at least 2 hours.",
        "Reheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Generously coat six 4-oz. fluted financier molds or a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray. Divide batter among molds (use about 1/3 cup batter per mold, or 2 mounded Tbsp. if using a muffin pan). Top with figs (if using) and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake until tops are browned and edges are firm, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let financiers cool 10 minutes in pans before turning out onto racks. Let cool completely.",
        "Batter can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled."
