        "Dip slices of green tomato into beaten egg, then cover in cornmeal to coat, shaking off the excess.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the tomato slices. Cook until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.",
        "Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel and place it over medium heat. Spread butter onto one side of each slice of bread. Place half of the slices butter side down in the skillet. Stack 3 slices of green tomato, 3 slices of red tomato, a slice of pepperjack cheese and a few jalapeno slices onto each piece of bread in the skillet. Top with the remaining slices of bread with the butter on the outside. Cook until the bottom is golden. Flip the sandwiches and cook until golden brown on the other side."
