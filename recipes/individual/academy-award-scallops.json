        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until very hot. Season the scallops with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook the scallops in the hot oil until evenly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops and set aside.",
        "Melt the butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook the green onions and orange zest in the butter for 1 minute. Stir in the wine and then the cream; bring to a boil while stirring and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the scallops to the sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer together until the scallops are heated through, about 5 minutes."
