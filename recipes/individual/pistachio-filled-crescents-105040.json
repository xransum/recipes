        "Stir together flour and baking powder. Stir together yogurt, oil, and yolks in another bowl, then gradually add flour, stirring until a soft dough forms. Put dough in a sealed plastic bag and let stand at room temperature 2 hours.",
        "Pulse pistachios, confectioners sugar, and cardamom in a food processor until finely ground (be careful not to overprocess into a paste). Bring water and sugar to a boil in a very small saucepan, stirring, then add syrup to pistachios and pulse to combine.",
        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Divide dough in half. Keeping one half wrapped in plastic wrap, roll out other half on a well-floured surface into a 15-inch round (about 1/16 inch thick). Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 2 3/4-inch cutter and add scraps to wrapped dough for rerolling. Mound 1 teaspoon filling in center of each round, then moisten edge of round with water and fold over to form a half-moon. Pinch edges together, then crimp with a fork to seal.",
        "Repeat with remaining dough and filling, rerolling scraps.",
        "Bake crescents 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets in batches in middle of oven until golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer parchment with crescents to a rack and when cookies are just cool enough to handle, toss, a few at a time, in confectioners sugar to coat, knocking off excess. Cool crescents completely on rack."
