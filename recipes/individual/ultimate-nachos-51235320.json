        "In a small bowl, whisk the oil, lime, garlic, chili powder, salt, and pepper together. Place the chicken in a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over. Toss to coat and marinate for 30 minutes.",
        "Heat a lightly oiled grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the chicken turning once until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Allow to cool, then cut chicken in 1/2-inch cubes.",
        "In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and bell pepper and cook, stirring, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes more. Stir in the chili powder and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Remove from heat.",
        "To the bowl of a food processor, add the beans, vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup water and pulse to combine. Add the onion mixture and pulse to combine. If necessary, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time and process until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Add a small dollop of bean dip to the center of each chip (about 1/4 teaspoon per chip) and divide chips among 2 rimmed baking sheets. Sprinkle evenly with jalape\u00f1o slices and cheeses. Bake until cheese is bubbling and melted and the edges of chips are just starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with tomato, onion, sour cream, grilled chicken, and cilantro. Serve immediately."
