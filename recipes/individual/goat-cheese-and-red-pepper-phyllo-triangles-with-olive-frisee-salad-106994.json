        "Cover phyllo stack with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap and then a damp clean kitchen towel. Arrange 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface with a long side nearest you (keep remaining sheets covered) and brush with some butter. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets, brushing each with butter.",
        "Cut buttered phyllo stack crosswise into 5 (12- by 3 1/3-inch) strips.",
        "Put 2 teaspoons red peppers and 2 teaspoons goat cheese near 1 corner of a strip and fold corner of phyllo over to enclose filling and form a triangle. Continue folding strip (like a flag), maintaining triangular shape. Put triangle, seam side down, on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Make 14 more triangles in same manner, using remaining phyllo and filling (you may have a little butter left over).",
        "Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry triangles in 2 batches until golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain.",
        "Whisk together vinegar, mustard, and salt in a large bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Add fris\u00e9e and olives and toss with dressing, then season with pepper. Mound salad on plates and arrange phyllo triangles alongside."
