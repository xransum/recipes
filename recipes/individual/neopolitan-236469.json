    "In heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together water and sugar until sugar dissolves. Simmer 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and add lemon verbena. Let steep 30 minutes, then strain and let cool. Cover and refrigerate syrup until cold, about 1 hour. Makes about 1 cup.",
    "In cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine vodka, lemon verbena syrup, and cranberry juice. Shake vigorously for about 6 seconds, then strain into 6-ounce cocktail glass. Garnish with orange peel and rosemary sprig, if using.",
    "If you can't find fresh lemon verbena, substitute the zest of 1 lemon, removed in strips with a vegetable peeler. Use an organic lemon if you can, or scrub it well before zesting to remove any pesticides."
