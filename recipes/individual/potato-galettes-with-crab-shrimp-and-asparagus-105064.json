        "Line microwave-safe plate with plastic wrap. Overlap enough potato rounds (about 12) on plastic to form 4-inch round. Microwave on high until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer potato galette to baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining potatoes and 3 teaspoons oil to form total of 4 galettes. (Reduced stock, asparagus, and galettes can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add leek. Cover and cook until just tender, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add crab, cream, and chives; simmer to heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Cover to keep warm. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; saut\u00e9 until just opaque in center, 3 minutes. Add asparagus; toss to heat through. Season with salt and pepper.",

Add galettes and cook until crisp and brown, 1 1/2 minutes per side; transfer 1 galette to each of 4 plates. Bring reduced stock to simmer. Remove from heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter; whisk just until melted.",
