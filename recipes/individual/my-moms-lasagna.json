        "In a large heavy bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.  Saute the onions and garlic until soft and slightly clear.  Pour in the crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Stir in the tomato paste, salt and pepper. Lower heat to medium, just hot enough to keep lightly bubbling.  Add basil leaves and cook, stirring occasionally for an hour. Add salt and pepper and red wine and allow to simmer another hour or until desired consistency.  Remove from heat and let it cool.  If you have time, let it sit in the refrigerator over night.",

        "You'll need two 9x13 inch baking trays. Put a layer of sauce in the bottom of the tray, then a layer of slightly overlapping lasagna noodles.  Spread a layer of ricotta over the noodles and a light sprinkling of mozzarella.  Repeat until you fill the tray, making sure that you end up with lasagna noodles on top.  Spread a layer of sauce over the noodles and sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan. Cover with foil.",
