        "In a bowl combine the apple juice, 1/2 cup of the soy sauce, the honey, the garlic, the gingerroot, the mustard, the Worcestershire sauce, and the rum. In a shallow dish arrange the pork chops in one layer, pour the marinade over them, and let them marinate, covered and chilled, turning them occasionally, overnight. Drain the marinade into a saucepan and add the jelly and the remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, boil it until it is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, and stir in the lemon juice and the nutmeg. Grill the pork chops on an oiled rack set about 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them and basting them with the sauce every 5 minutes, for a total 20 minutes, or until they are just cooked through. Serve the chops with the sauce."
