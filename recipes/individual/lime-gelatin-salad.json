        "Pour 1 cup boiling water over the gelatin mix in a large bowl. Stir it until it is dissolved. Add 1/2 cup pineapple juice. Place it in the refrigerator to partially gel. It is important that the gelatin is only partially gelled.",
        "Meanwhile, cook the pineapple in a small saucepan until it boils. Let it cook about 5 minutes. Cool it to room temperature.",
        "When the gelatin is partially gelled, blend the softened cream cheese into it until it is creamy. Mix in the cooled, cooked pineapple.",
        "Whip the cream until it is fluffy. Fold it into the gelatin-cream cheese mixture. Fold the nuts into the gelatin mixture. Pour it all into a pretty crystal bowl and place it in the refrigerator to completely gel."
