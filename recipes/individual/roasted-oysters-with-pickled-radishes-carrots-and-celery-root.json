        "Put the radishes, carrots and celery root in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, the sugar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour the pickling liquid over the radishes, carrots and celery, and cover with a plate to keep them submerged. Let cool to room temperature.",
        "Cover the bowl with plaster wrap and refrigerate for about an hour. Transfer the pickles and liquid to a container, cover and refrigerate.",
        "In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-low-heat. Add the leek, shallot and garlic and cook until soft, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, make the brown butter. In a small skillet, cook the butter over medium heat, swirling the pan, until the better melts and the milk solids turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
        "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F, or prepare an outdoor grill and let the coals burn until they turn white.",
        "To keep the oysters from tipping, spread the rock salt in a large baking pan and nestle the oyster in the salt, being careful not to spill the juices. With a spoon, gently lift each oyster from the shell, slip about 1/4 teaspoon of the cooked leek mixture into the shell, and set the oyster on top. Drizzle with a little brown butter.",
        "Bake in the over or cook on the grill until the oysters are just heated through, about 5 minutes. Top each oyster with a few pieces of pickled radishes, carrots, celery root and chives."
