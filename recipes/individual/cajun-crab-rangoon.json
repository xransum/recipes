        "Cook the bacon in a saucepan over medium heat until the bacon is limp, and is beginning to release its grease, about 3 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape the onion mixture into a mixing bowl, and stir in the cream cheese, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, dill, and crawfish tails. Gently fold in the crabmeat, then season to taste with salt and pepper.",
        "To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the seafood filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with the beaten egg. Fold each corner of the wrapper over the filling, and press together over the center of the won ton. Press the edges together to seal.",
        "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Fry the won tons in the hot oil until they turn golden brown and float, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving."
