        "In a food processor blend flours and remaining 2 tablespoons walnut until walnuts are ground fine. In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, water, flour mixture, and salt until batter is combined well but still slightly lumpy.",
        "Divide batter among muffin tins and bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes. Cut a slit about 1/2 inch long on top of each popover with a small sharp knife and bake 8 minutes more. (Popovers will not rise much because of walnuts.)"
