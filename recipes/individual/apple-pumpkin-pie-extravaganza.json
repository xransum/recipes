        "Place pumpkin halves cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the fresh is tender when pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Scoop pumpkin flesh out of the skin and into a food processor; puree until smooth.",
        "Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).",

        "Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoon flour until it forms a paste. Add remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, white sugar, and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.",

        "Cut top crust into 1/2-inch strips with a sharp knife or pastry wheel. Lay the 2 longest strips in an X in the center of the pie. Lay remaining strips on top, using the shortest ones on the edges, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Fold the ends under the edge of the bottom crust and flute the crust. Pour butter mixture gently over lattice.",
