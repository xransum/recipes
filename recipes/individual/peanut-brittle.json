        "In a large skillet mix the sugar, syrup, and water together. Cook at a medium-high heat, stirring regularly. Heat until the mixture has a hard ball consistency. You don't need a candy thermometer for this. When stirring, occasionally hold spoon above mixture, allowing it to drip off spoon. When mixture is at hard ball stage, it will \"hair\" off the spoon when falling, looking like a clear spider web.",
        "Once mixture is at hard ball consistency, add raw peanuts. (They will pop a little.) When mixture starts to turn a light clear-brown, as if it's starting to burn, remove from stove. Add soda and stir. Mixture will foam up.",
        "Spoon out bite-size pieces onto unbuttered foil, stirring constantly between each couple of pieces. Mixture can also be poured onto unbuttered foil as one big piece and broken into smaller pieces once cooled."
