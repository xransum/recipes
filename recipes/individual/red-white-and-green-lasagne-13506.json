In a vegetable steamer set over simmering water steam broccoli, covered, until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes, and stir into ricotta mixture with salt and pepper to taste.",

        "Pour 1 cup tomato sauce into a baking dish, 13 by 9 by 2 inches (sauce will not cover bottom completely), and cover with 3 lasagne sheets, making sure they do not touch each other. Drop about 1 1/2 cups ricotta mixture by spoonfuls onto pasta and gently spread with back of a spoon. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella and 1/3 cup Parmesan over ricotta mixture and make 2 more layers in same manner, beginning and ending with pasta. Spread remaining cup tomato sauce over pasta, making sure pasta is completely covered, and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.",
