        "Remove vegetables to a plate to make room, and place the beef heart in the pan, adding a bit more oil if necessary. Saute over medium heat until browned. Return the onion mixture to the pan, sprinkle in the cumin and beef bouillon. Pour in the red wine, mole sauce, and enough water to cover.
