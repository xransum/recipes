        "Remove lid and increase heat to moderately high, then cook, turning over occasionally, until all of liquid is evaporated and endive is very tender and well caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes.",
        "While endive is braising, pat fish dry and sprinkle with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 fish, uncovered, turning over once, until just cooked through, about 7 minutes total. Serve fish topped with endive."
