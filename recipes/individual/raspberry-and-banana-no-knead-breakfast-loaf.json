        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and line an 8 1/2 x 4-inch loaf pan with baking parchment. I make sure that the paper overlaps a little bit, which makes it much easier to remove the loaf from the pan once it is cooked.",
        "Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until nicely combined. Add the eggs in two batches, beating well between each addition. The mixture won\u2019t quite look its best, but it will soon come good! Add the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and baking powder and stir through until nicely mixed in. Then stir the bananas in, followed by a gentle fold in of the raspberries.",
        "Pour the mixture into the loaf pan, smooth it out a bit with the back of a spoon and then sprinkle the oats evenly over the top. Bake in the oven for 50\u201355 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean when the loaf is pierced in the center.",
        "Leave to cool in the pan for a few minutes before lifting out and leaving to cool completely on a wire rack. The loaf will stay at its best for 1 to 2 days when stored in an airtight container."
