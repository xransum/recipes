        "Pat steaks dry and sprinkle all over with remaining teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Grill steaks on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning steaks over once and moving them around grill to avoid flare-ups if necessary, until thermometer inserted horizontally 2 inches into meat (do not touch bone) registers about 120\u00b0F for rare, 9 to 12 minutes total. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes before slicing. (Internal temperature will rise to 125 to 128\u00b0F while steaks stand.) Thinly slice meat and serve with sauce."
