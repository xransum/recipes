        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Slightly overlap 2 slices of pancetta on work surface. Set 1 chicken breast half atop pancetta. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Top chicken with 1/4 of remaining herb mixture. Place 2 more slices pancetta atop chicken, tucking edges around chicken to enclose. Repeat with remaining pancetta, chicken and herbs.",
