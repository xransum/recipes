        "1. Place duck fat in a skillet, and cook over medium to high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, until the fat has melted and some of it has browned.",
        "2. Add the shallots, and cook for about 30 seconds, stirring occasionally. Add the liver, herbes de Provence, and garlic, and cook over medium to high heat for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the salt and pepper.",
        "3. Transfer the mixture to a blender, add the Cognac, and blend until liquefied. If a finer textured p\u00e2t\u00e9 is desired, push the mixture through the holes of a strainer with a spoon. This will yield 1/2 cup. Let cool for at least 1 1/2 hours, then cover and and refrigerate until serving time.",
        "4. Spread the p\u00e2t\u00e9 on the toasted baguette slices, and serve. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 will keep, well covered, for 3 to 4 days."
