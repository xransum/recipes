        "In a very clean 1-quart glass jar combine the rosemary leaves, the garlic, and the vinegar and let the mixture steep, covered with the lid, in a cool dark place for at least 4 days and up to 2 weeks, depending on the strength desired. Strain the vinegar through a fine sieve into a glass pitcher, reserving the garlic and discarding the rosemary leaves, and pour it into 2 very clean 1/2-pint glass jars. Add a rosemary sprig and some of the reserved garlic to each jar and seal the jars with the lids."
