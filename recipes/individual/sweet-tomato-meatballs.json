Cook the meatballs in the heated oil until no longer pink in the center, turning several times to maintain even coloring; remove and set aside, reserving drippings in the skillet. Stir the water and cornstarch together to dissolve cornstarch, then mix into the drippings. Replace skillet over medium heat, bring to a boil and stir until thickened; serve on side of meatballs."
