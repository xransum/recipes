        "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Butter 9-inch cast-iron skillet. Heat over medium-high heat. Add pears, rounded side down, to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Spoon syrup over pears. Transfer skillet to oven and roast pears until tender, turning and basting once, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and bring pear mixture to boil over high heat; boil until almost all juices have evaporated, about 2 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Place eggs, half and half, and vanilla in blender and process until smooth. Add flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and pinch of salt; blend to combine. Pour batter over pears in skillet. Bake until center is set and clafouti is puffed and golden brown at edges, about 40 minutes. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle over clafouti; serve warm."
