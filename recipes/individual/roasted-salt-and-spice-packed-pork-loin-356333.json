Heat olive oil in heavy large roasting pan over medium-high heat. Place pork, fat side down, in pan.

Push 2/3 to 3/4 of salt mixture to 1 side of pan, spreading remaining salt in long wide strip (about size of roast) as base for pork. Place pork, bone side down, on salt base. Pack remaining salt over entire roast, enclosing completely.",
        "Roast pork in salt crust until instantread thermometer inserted straight down into pork from top center registers 165\u00b0F, about 2 1/2 hours.",

        "With the pork, pour a C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne. We like the Domaine Rouge-Bleu 2007 \"Mistral\" (France, $18). Its blackberry and earthy flavors and anise notes complement the meat deliciously."
