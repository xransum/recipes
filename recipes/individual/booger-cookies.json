Beat in the egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and the almond extract until completely incorporated. Mix in the pudding mix until smooth.

        "While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling by stirring 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar in a bowl with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, milk, and food coloring. Add additional milk as needed to make the mixture smooth. Spoon a little of the green filling into each cooled cookie, and top with a candy kiss."
