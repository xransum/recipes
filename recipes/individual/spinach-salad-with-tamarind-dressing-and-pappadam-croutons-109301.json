        "Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet (2 inches deep) over moderate heat until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F (see cooks' note, below). Fry 1 pappadam, turning over once, until blistered and pale golden, about 1 minute total. Lift pappadam from skillet with tongs, letting excess oil drip back into skillet, and transfer to paper towels to drain (pappadam will crisp as it cools). Return oil to 350\u00b0F and fry remaining pappadams, 1 at a time, in same manner.",
