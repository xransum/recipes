        "In a small bowl, mix tuna, chili sauce and green onions. Blend in enough water to allow easy spreading.",

        "Starting at the top, roll up the tortilla into a snug cylindrical shape, ensuring the cream cheese seals the bottom.",
        "Enclose roll-ups in aluminum foil, and refrigerate or freeze until serving. When ready to serve, cut the roll-ups into 2 inch slices. If frozen, slice the roll-ups about 15 minutes before serving time to allow them to defrost completely."
