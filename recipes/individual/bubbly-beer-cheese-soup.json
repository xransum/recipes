Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Stir milk into the mixture, place over medium heat, and simmer until warm, about 5 minutes; add soy sauce and black pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese into the soup in small batches while stirring, allowing each addition to melt into the soup before adding more.",
