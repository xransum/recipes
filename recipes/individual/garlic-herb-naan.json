        "Combine garlic, herbs, salt, lemon zest, and 4 cups flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough hook.",
        "Combine sugar and 1 1/3 cups warm (105\u00b0F\u2013110\u00b0F) water in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water and let sit until foamy (it will smell very yeasty!), 8\u201310 minutes. Stir in buttermilk. Add to dry ingredients and mix on medium speed until a smooth, wet dough forms, 5\u20137 minutes.",
        "Transfer dough to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until at least doubled in size, 12\u201324 hours. (If the dough hasn\u2019t quite doubled, let sit at room temperature 30\u201360 minutes.)",
        "Gently punch down dough and turn out onto a very well-floured surface. Portion into four 3\"\u20134\"-diameter balls. Cover with a floured kitchen towel and let rise until pillowy and springy to the touch, 30\u201345 minutes.",
        "Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); lightly oil grate. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, gently stretch to about a 10x8\" oval. Grill over direct heat, turning and rotating as needed, until bread is stiff and both sides are lightly charred, about 3 minutes total. Move to indirect heat to keep warm while you grill the remaining piece of dough."
