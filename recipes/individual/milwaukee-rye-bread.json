        "In a small saucepan, cover peeled potatoes with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash; let cool. In a separate sauce pan, stir the cornmeal into the 3 cups water. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in salt, sugar and shortening. Let cool to lukewarm.",
        "In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add cooled cornmeal mixture and 2 cups of the cooled mashed potatoes. Stir in the rye flour and whole wheat flour 1 cup at a time; beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
        "Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into three equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into three lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom."
