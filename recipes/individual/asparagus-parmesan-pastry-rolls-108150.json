        "Unfold pastry sheets and halve each parallel to fold lines. Roll out 1 half (keep remaining 3 halves chilled, covered with plastic wrap) into a 20- by 7-inch rectangle with a floured rolling pin on a well-floured surface. (Pastry will shrink slightly after rolling.) Brush off excess flour from work surface and both sides of pastry, then trim all edges with a sharp knife to make even. Cut crosswise into 6 (6 1/2- by 3-inch) rectangles.",
        "Brush rectangles with some egg wash and sprinkle each evenly with 1 packed tablespoon cheese, leaving a 1/2-inch border on long sides. Lay an asparagus stalk along 1 long side, then roll up asparagus in pastry, pressing seam to seal. Make more rolls with remaining pastry, cheese, and asparagus.",
        "Arrange rolls, seam sides down, about 1 inch apart on lightly oiled baking sheets and brush top and sides lightly with egg wash. Chill rolls until pastry is firm, at least 15 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Bake rolls in batches in middle of oven until puffed and golden, about 16 minutes.",
        "Transfer with a metal spatula to a cutting board and trim about 1/2 inch from ends. Halve each roll crosswise, then, starting about 1/2 inch from either end, cut each section diagonally in half (see photo, opposite). Stand asparagus rolls on end, 2 by 2 on platters, and drizzle each with 1 drop of truffle oil (if using). Serve warm."
