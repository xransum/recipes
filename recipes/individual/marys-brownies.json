        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 or 9 inch square baking pans.",
        "Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir frequently until smooth. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool slightly.",
        "In a large bowl, stir together the sugar and butter until smooth. Mix in the egg yolks and melted chocolate, then stir in the flour. Combine milk and vanilla, and mix into the batter. In a separate glass or metal bowl, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold into the chocolate batter along with the walnuts. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pans.",
        "Bake for 28 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven. The edge of the brownies will pull away slightly from the side of the pan when done. Sprinkle one pan with confectioners' sugar and put chocolate frosting of your choice on the other. Enjoy!"
