Add short ribs in single layer and brown on all sides, about 12 minutes. Transfer ribs to plate. Add onion, carrot, celery, 2 thyme sprigs, and garlic to pot. Saut\u00e9 until vegetables brown, about 10 minutes. Return ribs to pot in single layer, meat side down. Add broth, vinegar, tarragon sprigs, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and bring to simmer (broth will not cover ribs). Bake uncovered until ribs are tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.",
