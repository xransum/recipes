        "With poultry shears or a sharp knife cut off necks, feet, and first 2 wing joints of each quail and discard. Cut out and discard backbones. Halve each quail lengthwise through breast and cut off legs. In a shallow bowl stir together flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Pour milk into another shallow bowl. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360\u00b0F.",
        "While oil is heating, working with 1 quail piece at a time dip half of pieces in milk, letting excess drip off, and dredge in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Arrange floured pieces on a tray. With tongs lower floured pieces, skin sides down, into hot oil. Fry quail, turning several times, until golden brown and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total, and transfer to paper towels to drain. Keep quail warm. Return oil to 360\u00b0F. and coat and fry remaining quail in same manner.",
