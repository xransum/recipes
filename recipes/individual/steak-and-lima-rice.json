        "Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the lima beans, and cook until wrinkled, about 10 minutes. Pour tomato sauce over the beans and stir in 2 cups of water and sugar. Cover and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes.",
        "Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown steaks on each side, then pour in just enough water to cover. Place a lid on the pan and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes over medium-low heat. Spoon some of the liquid into a cup or small bowl and mix with flour until smooth. Return to the pan and simmer until gravy has thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
