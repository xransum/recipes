        "Discard bouquet garni, then pur\u00e9e corn mixture in batches in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids), about 2 minutes per batch. Strain soup as pur\u00e9ed through a fine-mesh sieve into a large heavy saucepan, pressing on and then discarding solids.",
        "Return soup to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and keep warm over low heat. Thin with additional stock if necessary.",
        "Trim mushrooms, discarding any dark gills and tough stems, then slice or tear into bite-size pieces.",
        "Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until foam subsides, then cook mushrooms, stirring, until tender and golden, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and melt remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in skillet. Meanwhile, toss shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook shrimp in butter, turning occasionally, until barely cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Return mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in chives and salt and pepper to taste.",
