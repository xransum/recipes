        "Place crust atop filling. Fold dough edges under; crimp decoratively. Using small knife, cut eight 1-inch squares in crust, spacing apart and cutting through crust but leaving squares in place.",
        "Bake until crust is dry but still pale, about 35 minutes. Increase temperature to 400\u00b0F. Sprinkle crust with 1 tablespoon sugar; continue to bake until apples are tender, crust is golden, and juices bubble, about 35 minutes (mixture will be syrupy). DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool, cover, and chill. Rewarm uncovered in 300\u00b0F oven 20 minutes. Cool 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream."
