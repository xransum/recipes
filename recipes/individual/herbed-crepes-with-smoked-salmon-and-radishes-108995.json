        "Blend milk, flour, egg, and 2 teaspoons oil in a blender until smooth. Add chives and dill and pulse 1 or 2 times to just combine. Chill batter, covered, 30 minutes.",
        "Stir batter to redistribute herbs. Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with oil, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Holding skillet off heat, pour in half of batter (1/4 cup), immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next cr\u00eape.) Return skillet to heat and cook until cr\u00eape is just set and pale golden around edges, 10 to 15 seconds. Loosen edge of cr\u00eape with a heatproof plastic spatula, then flip cr\u00eape over carefully with your fingertips. Cook until underside is set, about20 seconds more. Transfer cr\u00eape to a plate. Make another cr\u00eape in same manner, brushing skillet again with oil.",
        "Stir together cream cheese, lemon juice, zest, and pepper in a small bowl until smooth.",
        "Put 1 cr\u00eape, browned side up, on a work surface, and spread with all of cheese mixture. Arrange salmon in an even layer over bottom half of cr\u00eape (side nearest you), then scatter radishes over salmon. Beginning at bottom, tightly roll up cr\u00eape, then cut roll crosswise into 4 pieces, trimming ends if desired."
