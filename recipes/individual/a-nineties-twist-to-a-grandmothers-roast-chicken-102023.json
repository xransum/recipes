        "Smash the garlic slightly with a knife and rub into the chicken well. Salt and pepper the chicken and cover with the herbs. Dribble with a little of the vegetable or olive oil. Cover and leave in the refrigerator overnight, turning the herbs and chicken once.",
        "Remove the herbs from the chicken. Heat a heavy ovenproof skillet large enough to hold all the pieces. Add the remaining tablespoon or 2 of the oil and place the chicken skin side down. Brown the chicken over a medium-high heat for about 5 minutes on one side.",
        "Remove the skillet with the chicken to a preheated 350-degree oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is crisp and the juices run clear."
