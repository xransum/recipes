        "Combine the vanilla ice cream and orange sherbet in a large bowl. Sprinkle the ice cream and sherbet with orange gelatin. Slowly pour the lemon-lime soda over the ice cream and sherbet; the mixture will be very foamy. Sprinkle a little more orange gelatin mix on top, if desired. Arrange several candy worms in the bowl so they drape over the sides and hang over the edge. Serve in cups and place a candy worm in each cup."
