        "Close the lid on the pressure cooker and bring to full pressure. Adjust the heat as needed. Once the pot comes to full pressure, cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and release the pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions. While the pressure is releasing, mix together the flour and 1/2 cup of water in a cup. Pour this into the pressure cooker, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until thickened."
