    "Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add ground beef and cook until brown, breaking up with fork, about 8 minutes. Drain drippings from Dutch oven. Mix parsley, bay leaves and basil into beef and cook 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, water, tomato sauce and tomato paste. Simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, breaking up tomatoes with spoon, about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat before using.)",
    "Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Place spaghetti in serving bowl. Pour half of sauce over. Serve immediately, passing Parmesan cheese separately. (Refrigerate or freeze remaining sauce for another use.)"
