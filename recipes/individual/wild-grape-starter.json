    "directions": [
        "Stem grapes into a medium mixing bowl.  Crush with hands. Cover with cheesecloth, and set aside for three days at room temperature.",
        "After three days there should be bubbles in the grape juice, indicating fermentation has begun.  Strain liquid, and discard skins.  Return to bowl, and stir in 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Set aside for 24 hours at room temperature.",
        "Measure 1 cup starter, discard any extra, and transfer to a 1 quart glass or ceramic container with a lid. Stir in 1 scant cup bread flour and 1 cup water.  The mixture should resemble a thick batter; add more water or flour if necessary to achieve this consistency. Cover loosely with lid.  Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat the following day.  Some activity should be noticeable: the mixture should be starting to bubble.   Repeat twice more. You will need to discard some of the mixture each day.",
        "Starter should be quite active.  Begin feeding regularly, every 4 to 6 hours, doubling the starter each time. For instance, if you have 1 cup starter, add 1 cup bread flour and 1 cup water. Alternatively, store in the refrigerator, and feed weekly."
