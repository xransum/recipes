        "Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat, and cook the pork until evenly browned.",
        "Mix the garlic into the Dutch oven, and cook 1 minute, until tender. Pour in the chicken broth, soy sauce, and cider vinegar. Place the bay leaves into the mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, and cook 1 hour, or until the pork is easily shredded with a fork. (For a thicker consistency, blend a small amount of flour with coconut milk, chicken broth, or water, then stir into sauce.) Make sure the meat stays moist and covered with the liquid. If meat looks like it's drying out, add a bit more chicken broth or water.",
        "Stir flour into coconut milk and add to the Dutch oven. Continue cooking until heated through."
