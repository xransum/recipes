        "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.",
        "Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Transfer fillets onto the baking sheet, reserving marinade.",
        "Place bok choy in the marinade; turn to coat. Arrange bok choy next to salmon on the baking sheet, reserving marinade.",
