        "To make the croutons, cut the bread slices into 3/4-inch cubes. In a fry pan over medium-high heat, combine the olive oil and garlic. Fry until the garlic turns brown, about 4 minutes; do not allow it to burn. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out and discard the garlic. Add the bread cubes to the pan and fry, stirring often, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.",
        "To make the soup, in a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the leeks and saut\u00e9 until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the broccoli and saut\u00e9, stirring frequently, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes more.",
