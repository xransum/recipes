Stir in the oil and anise extract. Fold in the dry ingredients until well blended. Spread the mixture into a 9x13 inch pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven.",
        "When the pan cools slightly, cut the cookie down the middle, lengthwise. Cut each half into 1/2 inch slices. Place slices onto a cookie sheet and return to the oven long enough to brown on each side, like toast. Store in a tightly covered container."
