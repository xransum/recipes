        "Bring a pot of water to a boil, and stir in half the walnuts; reduce heat to medium, and boil for 1 minute. Remove nuts with a slotted spoon, and let drain in a colander set in the sink. Repeat with remaining walnuts. Rinse the walnuts under hot water, and transfer to a mixing bowl. Toss the walnuts with the sugar.",
        "In an electric skillet with heat set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), heat the canola oil. With a metal slotted spoon, place enough nuts to cover the bottom of the skillet; the oil will sizzle and pop, so be careful to avoid spatters. Gently stir the nuts with the spoon. Fry the walnuts until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer the walnuts in clumps to a baking sheet.",
        "Sprinkle the nuts with salt, and let cool. Store in airtight container."
