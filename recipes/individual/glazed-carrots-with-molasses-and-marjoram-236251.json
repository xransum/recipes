        "Remove leaves from marjoram sprigs. Chop enough leaves to measure 2 teaspoons; reserve stems. Melt butter with oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots; season with salt and pepper. Toss with tongs until evenly coated and sizzling, about 4 minutes. Add orange juice, 1/2 cup water, molasses, and marjoram stems. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until carrots are almost tender, about 12 minutes. Uncover; increase heat to high and boil until juices are reduced to syrup and carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Discard marjoram stems. Add parsley and chopped marjoram; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper."
