        "Pour the batter into three 9-inch round cake pans.  Bake in the preheated oven approximately 30 minutes.  Place on wire racks until cool.",
        "While the layers are cooling make the filling.  Combine the egg yolks, 1/4  cup sugar, cornstarch, and pineapple juice in the top of a double boiler.  Cook until thick; stir often.  Cool, and spread filling on top of two of the layers. Sprinkle nuts and crushed pineapple  on top of filling.  Place these two layers one on top of the other, and place third layer on the top.  Frost with any white frosting."
