Divide among six 2/3-cup custard cups of souffl\u00e9 dishes. Dot tops with butter. Bake filling until hot and bubbling, about 18 minutes.",

Mix half and half, 6 tablespoons syrup and vanilla in another bowl. Add to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Working quickly, drop batter in three mounds, 1 heaping tablespoon per mound, atop hot filling in each cup. Brush topping with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar and nutmeg. Immediately return cups to oven and bake 8 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375\u00b0F. and bake until toppings are golden and just firm to touch, about 14 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes.",
