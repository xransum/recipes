        "Microwave creamed corn in a 1-quart Pyrex-type measuring cup to a full boil (or in a medium saucepan over medium heat). Stir in 1 cup of the cornmeal to make a very thick, pasty mush. If the mush is not stiff, microwave an additional 30 seconds or so. Whisk in buttermilk, then eggs and finally butter.",

        "Remove muffin tin from oven; coat with non-stick cooking spray. Divide batter evenly among cups (a spring-action ice cream scoop works well).",
        "Bake until golden brown on sides and bottom, about 15 minutes. Turn onto a wire rack; let cool 5 minutes. Serve."
