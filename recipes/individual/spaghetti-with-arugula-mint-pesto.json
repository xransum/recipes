        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente (tender but firm to the bite), 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and return it to the empty pot.",
        "Toss the pesto with the spaghetti. Thin it out with a small amount of reserved cooking water if needed. Taste, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the remaining 1 Tbs. lemon juice. Divide among warmed serving bowls. Sprinkle cheese over each portion and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
