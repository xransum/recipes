        "If you don't have a smoker with an offset box, you can build a fire on one side of your grill and then put a piece of foil on the opposite side of the grill. This will create indirect heat.",
        "Remove the thin, papery membrane skin from the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it off in a sheet with your fingers, using the corner of a kitchen towel to gain a secure grip, or with pliers.",
        "In a bowl, whisk together chile powder, salt, pepper, cumin, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and sugar.",
        "Generously season ribs with the mixture, rubbing onto both sides of the rack.",
        "Place the ribs, bone-side down, on foil to cook with lid closed. Cover the grill and keep the temperature of the grill at a constant 225\u00b0F. Cook the ribs for about 3 to 4 hours or until tender."
