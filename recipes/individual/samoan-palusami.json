Sprinkle with some of the corned beef, then keep repeating layers of spinach and corned beef until you run out of spinach. Don't worry about how full the dish is because the spinach will shrink as it cooks. Pour both cans of coconut milk over the dish, pressing the leaves down with a spoon. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.",
