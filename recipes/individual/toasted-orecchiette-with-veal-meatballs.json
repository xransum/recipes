Add veal and pork to bacon and mix with your hands to combine.",
        "Pulse whole garlic cloves and half of onion in food processor until finely chopped. Add one-fourth of meat mixture along with breadcrumbs, milk, coriander, red pepper flakes, allspice, paprika, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper and process until well blended, about 1 minute.
