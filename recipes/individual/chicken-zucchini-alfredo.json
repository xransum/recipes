        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup cooking water and drain pasta.",

Continue to cook and stir until zucchini are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl and cover with aluminum foil.",
        "Season chicken breast halves with kosher salt and black pepper.",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in the same skillet used to cook zucchini. Pan-fry chicken in hot oil until juices run clear and center is no longer pink, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cut into strips. Cover with aluminum foil.",
        "Whisk milk and flour together in a bowl.",
