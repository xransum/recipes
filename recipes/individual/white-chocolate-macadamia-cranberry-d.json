To make refrigerator cookies -  Roll dough into 2 rolls, wrap with plastic wrap and chill or freeze. (If you freeze the dough - thaw for at least 1/2 hr).  Slice 1 inch slices - cut into 4 and place on baking sheet point up.  For fancier cookies:   Drizzle melted white chocolate on chocolate cookies and melted dark chocolate on the white cookie.  Enjoy"
