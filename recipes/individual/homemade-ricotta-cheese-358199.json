        "Stack 4 large squares of cheesecloth in colander, leaving overhang. Combine milk and buttermilk in heavy large pot. Attach deep-fry or candy thermometer to side of pot. Place pot over high heat. Stir almost constantly as mixture heats and curds (small clumps) begin to form. When thermometer registers 175\u00b0F to 180\u00b0F, curds will separate from whey (liquid) and float to top. Turn off heat.",
        "Using large slotted spoon or skimmer, transfer curds to prepared colander. Gather cheesecloth around ricotta. Press gently, releasing some liquid (don't press out too much liquid or cheese may be dry). Return ball of cheese to colander and let rest 20 minutes. Transfer ricotta to medium bowl. Sprinkle lightly with salt; mix gently. Cover; chill until cold, about 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled."
