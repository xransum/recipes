        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x13-inch baking dishes with cooking spray.",
        "Bring a large pot of water with olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil; add whole wheat penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.",
        "Cook and stir turkey, onion, red bell pepper, garlic, remaining salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a large skillet over medium-low heat until turkey is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease.",
        "Place sausages in a pot and cover with cold water; bring water to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until sausages are no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
        "Remove and discard sausage casings; chop sausage and stir into turkey mixture. Stir penne, 1 1/2 jars tomato-basil sauce, diced tomatoes, shredded block of mozzarella-style vegan cheese, 1 package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and remaining black pepper into turkey-sausage mixture.",
