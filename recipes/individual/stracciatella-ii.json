Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat and simmer 45 minutes, until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken and reserve stock.  When cool enough to handle, bone chicken and cut meat into bite-size pieces.",

Chop the remaining 3 carrots, 3 stalks of celery and 1 onion and stir into the chicken mixture with the rice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.",
