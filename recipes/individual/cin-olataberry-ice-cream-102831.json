        "Freeze in an ice cream maker. When the ice cream has thickened, remove the canister from the ice and salt, then remove the dasher and pat down the ice cream with a rubber scraper to remove excess air. Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent ice crystal formation. Replace the canister lid and place in a freezer to harden for 3-5 hours."
