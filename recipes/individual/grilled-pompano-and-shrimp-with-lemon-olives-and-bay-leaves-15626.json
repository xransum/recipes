        "With a sharp knife cut ends from lemons. Standing each lemon on a cut side, cut rind and pith from lemon, exposing flesh. Cut lemon segments free from membranes. Discard coarse stems from spinach. Flatten olives, a few at a time, with flat side of a large heavy knife to loosen pit from flesh and discard pits. In a small saucepan stir together olives, extra-virgin olive oil, bay leaves, and a pinch salt.",
        "Season shrimp and pompano with salt and pepper and grill on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until just cooked through, about 3 minutes on each side. (Alternatively, grill seafood in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer seafood with tongs to a platter and keep warm, covered. Heat olive mixture over low heat until warm.",
        "In a 12-inch skillet heat remaining tablespoon olive oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 spinach, stirring and turning it with tongs, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season spinach with salt and pepper.",
