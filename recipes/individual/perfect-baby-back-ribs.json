        "Spray the insert of a large (at least 6 quarts) slow cooker with nonstick spray. Place the ribs in the insert, cutting the racks in half if needed to fit. Pour the beer on the bottom of the insert. Cover and cook on low until the meat is tender but still intact (about 9 hours).",
        "When the ribs are almost cooked, prepare a grill for high heat.",
        "Remove the cooked ribs from the slow cooker, blot any excessive (dripping) moisture and place them on the hot grill. Cook until a nice char is formed, 10 to 15 minutes, coating them with BBQ sauce (if using) as they cook."
