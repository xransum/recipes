        "Cut the corn bread in half and cut each half crosswise into 4 pieces (each about 4 by 2 inches). Halve each piece horizontally with a serrated knife and spread the bottom halves of the corn bread with some of the mustard. Layer the bottom halves with the prosciutto and the M\u00dcnster, cover the sandwiches with the top halves of the corn bread, and wrap each sandwich in foil or plastic wrap.",
        "In a bowl stir together the flour, the cornmeal, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt, add the milk, the egg, the butter, and the cuminseed, and stir the mixture until it is combined. Spread the batter in an even layer in a greased 8-inch-square baking pan, bake the corn bread in the middle of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and the top is golden, and invert it onto a cutting board."
