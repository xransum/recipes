        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Cut each puff pastry sheet into 4 equal rectangles, creating 8 total. Spoon mushroom mixture into the center of each rectangle; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Gather all 4 corners of a rectangle together around the filling; pinch corners and edges of puff pastry together forming a seal. Repeat with remaining rectangles. Arrange bundles on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly press bundles so the bottoms are flat.",
