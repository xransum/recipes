        "Peel and trim the turnips. If small, cut them into wedges about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. If large, cut the turnip in half through the equator, then cut into wedges. Peel the sweet potatoes. Cut in half lengthwise and then slice lengthwise about 1/2 inch thick; cut slices into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch sections.",
