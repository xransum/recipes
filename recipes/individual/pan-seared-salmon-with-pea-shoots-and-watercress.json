        "To make the dressing, in a large bowl, combine the lemon juice, shallots, salt and pepper and whisk until the salt dissolves. Let stand for 30 minutes to allow the shallot flavor to mellow. Add the olive oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly until the dressing is well blended. Set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, sprinkle the salt in a wide, heavy fry pan and place over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the salmon fillets and sear for 2 minutes. Turn the fish over and sear for 1 minute on the other side. Sprinkle with the pepper. Reduce the heat to low, then pour in the wine and 2 Tbs. of the lemon juice. Cover and cook until the juices are nearly absorbed and the fish is halfway cooked, about 3 minutes. Uncover and pour in 2 Tbs. of the lemon juice and 3 Tbs. of the water. Cover and cook just until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes. Most of the pan juices will have been absorbed.",
        "Whisk the dressing to recombine. Add the watercress and pea shoots to the dressing and toss gently to coat, then divide the greens among individual plates. Place a salmon fillet on each mound of greens.",
        "Increase the heat under the fry pan to high, add the remaining 4 Tbs. lemon juice and 1 Tbs. water, and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the pan bottom. Pour the pan juices evenly over the fish and serve immediately. Serves 8.",
