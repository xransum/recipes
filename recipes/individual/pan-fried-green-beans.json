        "In a stainless steel pot over medium-high heat, combine green beans, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, until the beans begin to sweat.  Remove lid and stir occasionally until beans are tender.",
        "When the beans and spices have begun to 'burn' on the bottom of the pan, which will lend a grilled flavor, stir in the olive oil and turn off heat.  Cover, and let stand a few minutes.  Scrape the bottom of the pan to incorporate the  'burnt' spices.  Beans should have a dark, caramel color, but not black."
