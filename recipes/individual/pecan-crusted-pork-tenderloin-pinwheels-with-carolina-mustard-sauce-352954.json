        "Cut the tenderloin lengthwise into 6 long strips approximately 1/4 inch thick. Lay the slices on a cutting board; they should be the same size and shape as the bacon strips. Place a strip of bacon on top of each piece of tenderloin. Starting at one end, roll the tenderloin into a pinwheel medallion. Secure with two toothpicks.",
        "Set aside 1 cup of the Carolina Mustard Sauce and apply remaining sauce to the outside of the pinwheels. Stir together the pecans, salt, and pepper, and coat the tenderloin pinwheels with the pecan mixture. Cut each of the pinwheels through the equator to make two thin pinwheel medallions.",
        "Build a charcoal and/or wood fire for direct grilling. Place the medallions on the grill over medium-high heat (375 to 400\u00b0F) and cook for 7 to 8 minutes on each side or until the edges of the bacon start to crisp. Serve with the reserved sauce drizzled over each pinwheel."
