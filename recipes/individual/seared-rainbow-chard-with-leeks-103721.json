        "Cut stems from chard (if leaves are large, cut out coarse portions of rib), then cut stems crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Stack chard leaves and roll into cylinders. Cut cylinders crosswise to make 1-inch-thick strips of leaves.",
        "Heat butter and oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saut\u00e9 chard stems and leeks with sea salt and pepper to taste, stirring occasionally, until slightly soft, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Add chard leaves and continue to saut\u00e9, stirring frequently, until wilted. (If greens begin to brown before they wilt, sprinkle with a few drops of water.)"
