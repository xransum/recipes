        "Place the yuca, 3 quarts water, and salt in a 4-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook at a gentle boil until either fork-tender (Paraguayan style), about 25 minutes, or very tender (Cuban style), 30 to 40 minutes. Drain, quickly removing the spindles, and serve at once; or keep warm in the cooking water over very low heat until ready to serve. Douse with a table sauce if you wish, and serve piping hot."
