Stir in the onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and salt; continue cooking until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Drain off the excess grease, and add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.",
