        "Cook the barley",
        "In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil. Add the 1 tsp. salt and the barley and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook the barley until just tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Drain and set aside.",
        "Prepare the soup base",
        "When the barley has been cooking for about an hour, set a large saucepan over medium heat and melt the butter. Add the onion and mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until the onion is translucent and the mushrooms have released their juices, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and beef, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes.",
        "Finish the soup",
        "When the barley is ready, add it to the soup and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
