Blend on medium-high speed to form a smooth paste. With the blender on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Season with more salt and pepper and set aside.",

        "Brush the chicken on both sides with the olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on the grill or in the grill pan and cook, turning once if using a grill pan, until opaque throughout. Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for 5 minutes, then thinly slice the chicken crosswise.",
        "To assemble the salad, in a bowl, toss the romaine with the enough dressing to lightly coat. Add the walnuts and toss to combine. Divide the salad among 4 plates and top with the chicken slices. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the cheese over the salads and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
