        "Cut an X in root end of each onion, then cook onions in an 8-qt pot of boiling salted water (2 1/2 tablespoons salt for 5 quart water) until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath to stop cooking (keep pot of water at a boil), then drain onions well. Discard any skins and squeeze onions at stem end so small layers slip out separately.",
        "Boil peas until just tender, about 2 minutes, cooling and draining in same manner as onions, then wax beans, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer onions, peas, and beans to a large serving bowl.",
        "Warm chorizo, oil, and vinegar in a heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat. Remove from heat. Add 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper, then pour over vegetables and toss to coat."
