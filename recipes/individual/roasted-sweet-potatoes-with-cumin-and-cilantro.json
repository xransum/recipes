        "Cut the potatoes lengthwise into slices 1/2 inch thick. Stack half of the slices and cut lengthwise into strips 1/2 inch wide. Repeat with the remaining slices. Rinse the strips with cold water and spread on a clean kitchen towel; blot dry with a second kitchen towel.",
        "Place the potatoes in a bowl. Drizzle with the oil, sprinkle with the cumin and toss to coat evenly.",
        "Preheat a nonstick baking sheet in the oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully arrange the potatoes in a single layer on the hot baking sheet. Roast the potatoes, turning every 10 minutes, until evenly browned and tender when pierced with a knife, 30 to 35 minutes.",
        "Transfer the potatoes to a serving dish and sprinkle with the salt, a grind of pepper and the cilantro. Toss gently to coat. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
