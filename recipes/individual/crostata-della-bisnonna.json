        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch pie plate or tart pan.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the butter and sugar using a wooden spoon until smooth. Mix in the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl, and mix just until you can form a solid ball out of the pastry with no crumbs.",
        "Reserve some of the dough for a lattice top. On a floured surface, roll the rest of the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Press into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan. Pour the apricot preserves into the crust, and spread evenly. Roll out the remaining dough, along with any scraps from the crust, to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into strips, and lay across the apricot preserves in a crosswise pattern.",
        "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the pastry is golden brown."
