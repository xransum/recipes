        "Juice the carrots through a vegetable juicer. Skim any foam off the top. Pour the juice into a saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring the sauce up to just before the boiling point (tiny bubbles will begin to form) and remove from heat. Whisk in cubes of cold butter one at a time until all are incorporated.",
        "Place back on the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Add cayenne, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Just before serving, add the fine herbs. This sauce is best made minutes before serving."
