    "Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in basil. Set aside. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and shallots and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add lamb; sauté until cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Add zucchini and sauté until wilted, about 7 minutes. Add wine, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Return to pot. Add zucchini-lamb mixture and basil butter to pasta; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan."
