    "directions": [
        "In a food processor chop coarse the olives and the capers. The olive and caper spread may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, brush them with the oil, and season them with salt and pepper. Grill the steaks on a rack set 4 inches over glowing coals for 10 minutes on each side for rare to medium-rare meat. (Alternatively, the steaks may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 10 minutes on each side.) Let the steaks stand, covered loosely with foil, for 8 minutes. Serve the steaks, sliced, with the olive and caper spread garnished with the parsley."
