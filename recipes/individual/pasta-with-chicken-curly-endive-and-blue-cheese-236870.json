        "Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; saut\u00e9 until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; add to skillet with rosemary and saut\u00e9 until chicken is almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add endive; toss until slightly wilted and chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute.",
