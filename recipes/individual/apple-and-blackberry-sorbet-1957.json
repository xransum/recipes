Cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer until fruit is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Transfer to sieve set over large bowl. Press to force through as much fruit and liquid as possible. Discard solids in sieve.",
    "Return puree to same pot. Add sugar and corn syrup. Stir over low heat just until sugar dissolves. Spoon puree into 13x9x2-inch glass dish. Freeze until almost solid, about 1 hour.",
    "Break up frozen puree into chunks. Place in processor; puree. Return to same dish; cover and freeze until firm enough to hold shape in spoon, at least 1 hour."
