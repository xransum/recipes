        "In a saucepan scald the milk with the garlic, let the mixture stand off the heat for 15 minutes, and strain it through a sieve, discarding the garlic. In a bowl whisk together the whole eggs and the yolks, add the milk in a stream, whisking, and stir in the parsley, the salt, and pepper to taste. Divide the bread cubes among 8 well-buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins, ladle the custard mixture over them, dividing it evenly, and let the bread puddings stand for 10 minutes. The puddings may be prepared up to this point 8 hours in advance and kept covered and chilled. Bake the puddings in a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 45 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed. Let the puddings cool for 10 minutes (they will sink as they cool), run a thin knife around the side of each pudding, and lift the puddings out carefully with a fork. Serve the garlic bread puddings warm."
