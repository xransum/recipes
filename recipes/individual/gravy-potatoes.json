Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat through until bubbly, then set aside and wait for the potatoes.",
        "When the potatoes are ready, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and split them in half lengthwise. Break up the centers of the potatoes with a fork, then pour the ground beef mixture over the top. Sprinkle with shredded cheese.",
