        "In 12-quart heavy pot, combine chicken and enough water to cover, about 8 quarts. Bring to boil, skimming froth. Add onions, carrots, celery, parsnips, sweet potato, and dill, and simmer, partially covered, 3 hours.",
        "Pour stock through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl, reserving chicken and discarding remaining solids. Refrigerate stock, covered, until completely cool, then skim fat from surface. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones, shred meat, and refrigerate until ready to use.",

Add carrots and celery, and continue simmering until noodles are tender, about 4 minutes. Add shredded chicken and simmer until heated through. Serve hot."
