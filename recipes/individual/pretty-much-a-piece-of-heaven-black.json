        "Combine chocolate cake mix and instant pudding mix in a large bowl. Add eggs, water, and vegetable oil; mix well to combine. Mix in 1/2 cup maraschino cherry juice until smooth. Stir in cherry pieces and chocolate chips. Divide cake batter between prepared pans, filling each halfway.",
        "Bake cakes in the preheated oven until toothpicks inserted in the centers come out clean, 26 to 32 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, 10 minutes. Remove from pans and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 1 hour.",
        "Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add sugar and cream of tartar. Increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form, 4 to 6 minutes.",
        "Spread 1/4 of the whipped cream evenly over the bottom cake layer. Cover whipped cream with a thin layer of pie filling. Place second layer of cake on top. Spread another 1/4 of the whipped cream over the second layer; cover with pie filling. Place third layer of cake on top. Spread remaining whipped cream on top; cover with remaining pie filling."
