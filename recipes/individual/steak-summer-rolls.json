    "Combine vinegar, water, 2 tablespoons sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes in a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel bowl; stir until sugar is dissolved. Add carrots and daikon radish. Put a plate on top to weigh down vegetables and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.",
    "Combine soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, and garlic in a shallow baking dish; stir until sugar is dissolved. Add steak, pressing down until steak is covered in marinade, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.",
    "Heat a ridged grill pan over high heat; add oil. Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Grill steak until desired doneness is reached, 6 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board and cool. Slice across grain into 24 thin slices.",
    "Drain carrot and daikon radishes, reserving 1/2 cup pickling liquid.",
    "Fill a shallow bowl with warm water. Dip 1 rice paper sheet into water to soften, about 5 seconds. Transfer sheet to a work surface. Arrange 2 pieces of lettuce over the half of wrapper closest to you. Top each lettuce leaf half with 2 slices of steak. Add about 1/4 cup carrot and daikon pickles and a few cilantro sprigs. Starting with bottom edge, begin to roll up rice paper sheet tightly around filling. After 1 roll, fold in ends of rice paper like a burrito, then finish rolling. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Diagonally cut rolls in half crosswise and arrange on a serving platter.",
    "Whisk peanut butter, reserved pickling liquid, and sriracha hot sauce together in a bowl; serve on the side with rolls."
