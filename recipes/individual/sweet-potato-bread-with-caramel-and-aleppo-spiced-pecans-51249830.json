        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F minutes. Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Pierce sweet potato several times with a fork and place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. Bake until soft and cooked through, 50 to 60 minutes. Scoop out flesh into a blender or food processor; discard skin. Add milk and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Scrape the potato mixture into a medium bowl and return 1 1/3 cups of the mixture to the blender. Add eggs, oil, vanilla, and dark brown sugar and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl.",
        "Lower the oven to 325\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in three batches to avoid overworking the flour. Make sure batter is fully mixed.",
        "Pour batter into prepared loaf pan and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in oven, rotating once, until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 2 hours.",
        "Run the dull side of a bread knife along the inner edges of the loaf pan. Unmold the bread and drizzle with caramel. Sprinkle with sea salt, Aleppo pepper, and pecans before serving."
