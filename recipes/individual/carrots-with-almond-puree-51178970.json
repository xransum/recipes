        "Combine almonds and oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook, swirling often, until almonds are just golden, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer almonds to a blender; let almonds and oil cool. Pulse almonds until finely chopped. With motor running, slowly add cooking oil, vinegar, sugar, and 1/4 cup water and process, adding water as needed, until just thinner than peanut butter; season with salt.",
