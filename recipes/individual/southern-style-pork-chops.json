        "Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Liberally sprinkle the onion soup mix over both sides of the pork chops. Fry the pork chops in the hot oil until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the chops from the skillet, and set aside.",
        "Pour the white wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to low. Stir the heavy cream, and season with garlic powder and salt and pepper. Gently lay the pork chops in the pan, turning to coat in the sauce. Simmer until thoroughly reheated, 5 to 10 minutes."
