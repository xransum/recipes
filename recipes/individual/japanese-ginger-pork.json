    "In a large bowl, mix together the ginger, soy sauce, sake and mirin. Add the sliced pork, cover, and marinate for about 1 hour.",
    "Heat the oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Add the pork, and fry until brown. The pork should have a dark crispy look to it. Do not cook on low or medium heat, as the juices will not cook fast enough to get a crispy texture. Discard leftover marinade."
