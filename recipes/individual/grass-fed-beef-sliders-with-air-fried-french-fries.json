        "To make the French fries, put the potatoes in a bowl, add water to cover and let soak for 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat a Philips airfryer to 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C).",
        "Drain the potatoes and rinse well. Place on a towel-lined baking sheet and pat dry, removing as much moisture as possible. Transfer to a bowl and add the canola oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat.",
        "Place the potatoes in the fry basket and insert into the airfryer. Cook for 5 minutes, then increase the temperature to 390\u00baF (199\u00b0C). Pull out the basket and, using tongs, toss and stir the potatoes. Return the basket to the fryer. Continue cooking until the potatoes are cooked through and golden brown on the outside about 15 minutes more, opening the basket 2 or 3 times during cooking to toss and stir them.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sliders: Divide the ground beef into eight 2-oz. (60-g) balls and form into patties. Season on both sides with salt and pepper.",
        "In a fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Working in batches, add the patties to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Turn them over, top each with a piece of cheese and cook for about 2 minutes more for medium, or until done to your liking. Transfer the burgers to a platter and let rest for 1 minute. Place on the buns and top with sliced tomatoes, red onion, pickles and lettuce. Serves 4.",
