        "Grate 5 of the potatoes on the largest holes of a box grater. Toss the potatoes with the vinegar and place in a mesh strainer. Place a couple plates on top of the potatoes and weigh the potatoes down to try and squeeze out the excess water. Let sit for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.",
        "Cut the remaining 3 potatoes into 6 pieces each. Place them in a saucepan with the garlic. Cover the potatoes with water by about 1-inch. Season the water generously with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and simmer until they are fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Strain and, while the potatoes are still hot, pass them through a food mill or mash with a potato masher.",
        "Combine the grated potatoes and the mashed potatoes. In a small dish, beat the 2 eggs and add to the potato mixture. Season with salt.",
        "Coat a large saute pan or cast iron pan with olive oil and bring to a medium high heat. Make a 3-inch patty with the potato mixture, cook it, and eat it to make sure that the potato mix is seasoned perfectly. Re-season if needed.",
        "Working in batches, make and cook all the pancakes, until they are brown and crispy and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Blot the pancakes on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Hold on a sheet tray to keep warm in the oven until serving."
