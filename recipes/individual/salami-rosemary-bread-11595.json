        "In a small bowl proof the yeast in 1 cup of the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy, and in another small bowl dissolve the table salt in the remaining 1 cup water. In a large bowl stir together the yeast mixture, the salt water, and 4 cups of the flour until a dough is formed, turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead in the salami, the rosemary, and enough of the remaining 2 cups flour to form a slightly sticky dough. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, form it into a ball, and transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil.",
        "Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk, knead it for 30 seconds, and form it into a 16-inch-long loaf. Transfer the loaf to a lightly oiled baking sheet and let it rise, uncovered, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk. Make four 1/4-inch-deep slashes in the top of the loaf and brush the loaf with the glaze. Sprinkle the loaf with the coarse salt and bake it in the middle of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F. and bake the loaf for 30 minutes more, or until it sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped. Transfer the loaf to a rack and let it cool."
