        "Bring heavy cream and cream of coconut to a boil in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat, whisking occasionally. Whisk cornstarch mixture, then add to cream in a stream, whisking. Boil custard, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Remove from heat and immediately whisk in eggs and coconut extract.",
