In a separate bowl, combine arugula, remaining 2 tbsp oil, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Make crust. While second side of each crust is grilling, spread 1/8 cheese mixture over cooked side of each crust; dollop each with1/3 cup sauce. (Do not spread.) Top with arugula. Rotate 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is golden brown."
