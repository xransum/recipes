        "In a food processor or blender, blend the garlic and 1/2 cup of vinegar until smooth.  In a 6 to 8 quart saucepan, combine the garlic mixture, remaining 1 1/2 cups vinegar and sugar.  Over high heat bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.  Quickly add the pectin.  Return the mixture to a boil and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat.",
        "Immediately fill five, sterilized half pint jars with the jelly, leaving 1/4-inch head space. Wipe the jar tops and threads clean.  Place hot sealing lids on the jars and apply the screw on rings loosely.  Process in boiling water in a deep canning pot for 5 minutes.  Remove the jars and cool completely.  Tighten the jar screw rings to complete the sealing process."
