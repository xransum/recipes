Line bowl with bread, buttered side up, cutting pieces to cover bowl completely. Pour berry mixture into bread-lined bowl. Top with remaining bread, buttered side down, cutting pieces to cover completely. Fold plastic wrap over bread. Place plate slightly smaller than top of bowl atop pudding. Weigh down plate with 4 pounds of canned goods or dried beans and chill at least 12 hours and up to 36 hours.",
