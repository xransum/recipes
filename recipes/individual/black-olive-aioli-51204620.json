        "Place the egg yolk in a stainless-steel bowl. Begin whisking in the grape-seed oil drop by drop, as slowly as you can bear. Continue in this manner, following with the olive oil, as the mixture thickens. Once the mayonnaise has emulsified, add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking all the time. If the mixture gets too thick and is difficult to whisk, add a drop or two of water.",
        "Pound the garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt with a mortar and pestle. Add half the olives, and pound to a paste. Roughly chop the remaining olives. Fold the garlic-olive paste and the chopped olives into the mayonnaise. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, a squeeze of lemon juice, and the cayenne pepper. Taste for balance and seasoning. If the a\u00efoli seems thick and gloppy, thin it with a little water; this will also make it creamier."
