  "directions": [
    "Cut pork crosswise into 1-inch-thick medallions; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt butter and oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add pork and sauté until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork to plate; tent with foil to keep warm. Add shallots to skillet and stir 1 minute. Add cream, broth and Calvados; boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, stirring up browned bits, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Divide medallions among 6 plates. Top with sauce; serve with compote."
