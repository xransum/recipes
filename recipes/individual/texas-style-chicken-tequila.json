        "Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and jalapeno, and saute until soft. Pour in chicken stock, tequila, and lime juice. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced to a paste, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure it is not sticking.",
        "While the sauce is cooking, place the chicken in a bowl, and pour soy sauce over it. Melt remaining butter in a skillet, and saute the onion, red bell pepper and green bell pepper until soft. Remove vegetables, and set aside.",
        "Add oil to the skillet, and cook the chicken over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Pour in the sauce and heavy cream, and add the peppers. Bring to a boil, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in Romano cheese and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired. Serve immediately."
