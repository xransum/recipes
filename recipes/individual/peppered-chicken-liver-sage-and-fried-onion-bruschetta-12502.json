        "Pat chicken livers dry. Add garlic to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until pale golden. Add chicken livers and saut\u00e9 over moderately high heat until golden and just springy to the touch, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side. Stir in minced or crumbled sage, pepper, salt, and allspice and in a food processor coarsely pur\u00e9e.

        "With a serrated knife cut bread crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Grill slices on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp outside but still soft inside. Alternatively, slices may be broiled in batches under a broiler about 4 inches from heat 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until golden. Rub toasts with garlic on one side and lightly brush same side with oil. Toasts may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container. Makes about 45 toasts."
