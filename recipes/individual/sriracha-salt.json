        "Stir the chile sauce and the salt together thoroughly. Spread it out into a thin layer on a dry baking sheet and set in the sun for 1 to 2 days, until dry. Alternatively, you can dry it in a dehydrator, or in an oven set at 100\u00b0F overnight, until dry. When completely dry, break up any clumps with your fingers or a spoon, and transfer it to a container with a tight-fitting lid.",
        "You can use any chile or hot sauce you like for this recipe. My favorite is Green Tabasco!"
