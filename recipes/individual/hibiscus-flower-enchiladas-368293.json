        "Bring hibiscus flowers and 2 cups water to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from heat; let steep until flowers are just tender, 5-8 minutes. Strain; reserve flowers. Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat; add onion and saut\u00e9 until soft but not brown. Add reserved hibiscus flowers, carrots, and next 4 ingredients; cook, stirring often, until carrots are soft and liquid evaporates, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.",
        "Combine the first 4 ingredients and 2 cups water in a pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to fall apart, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a blender; pur\u00e9e until smooth. Wipe out pot; add oil and heat over medium-high heat. When oil begins to smoke, carefully add pur\u00e9e and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.",
        "Pour oil into a large skillet to a depth of 1/4\"; heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, submerge tortillas and cook, turning once, until they soften, 30-45 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Put 1/4 cup of filling in center of each tortilla; roll to enclose. Place 2 enchiladas on each plate. Smother with chipotle sauce and garnish with sour cream, cabbage, and Cotija cheese."
