        "Arrange rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425\u00baF. Finely zest lemon into a medium bowl. Cut zested lemon in half lengthwise; set one half aside and reserve the other for another use. Add garlic, chives, parsley, and butter and mash together with a fork.",
        "Pat inside and outside of chicken dry. From edge of cavity, loosen skin from breasts and thighs. Push butter mixture under skin, then gently rub outside of skin to evenly distribute over breasts and legs. Tie together legs with twine. Season chicken with 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.",
        "Heat roasting pan in oven 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss potatoes, bacon, caraway seeds, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. oil in a large bowl. Toss cabbage and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper, and 1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. oil in another large bowl.",
        "Remove pan from oven; quickly combine and arrange potato mixture, cabbage mixture, and remaining oil left in bowls in pan, spreading toward edges to make room for chicken. Place chicken, breast side up, on top; it\u2019s okay if chicken sits on some vegetables. Carefully return pan to oven and roast 25 minutes (some cabbage edges will be blackened).",
        "Remove pan from oven; squeeze reserved lemon half over chicken and vegetables. Gently stir vegetables to coat with pan drippings. Reduce oven temperature to 400\u00baF and continue roasting until chicken juices run clear when thigh is pierced with a fork and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165\u00b0F, 40\u201350 minutes more.",
        "Transfer chicken to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Carve, serve with vegetable mixture, and top with parsley leaves."
