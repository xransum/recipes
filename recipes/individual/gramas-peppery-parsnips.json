        "Place the parsnips into a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat, and simmer until parsnips are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well, pat the parsnip pieces dry with paper towels, and set aside.",
        "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and place the parsnips into the hot butter in an even layer. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper (I use quite a bit). Cook parsnips until lightly golden brown on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side."
