    "Divide ribs between two large heavy sealable plastic bags. In a bowl stir together remaining ingredients and pepper to taste and pour over ribs. Seal bags, pressing out excess air. Marinate ribs, chilled, turning bags occasionally, overnight.",
    "Preheat oven to 375°F.",
    "Transfer ribs and marinade to a roasting pan large enough to hold ribs in one layer and roast ribs, turning occasionally, 2 hours, or until marinade is reduced to about 1 cup, about 50 minutes. Ribs may be made 2 days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered. Reheat ribs in a preheated 375°F. oven until hot, about 12 minutes."
