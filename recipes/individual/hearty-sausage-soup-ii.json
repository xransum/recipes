Add the water, cabbage, carrots, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, beef bouillon cubes, seasoned salt, thyme, and cayenne pepper to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the stockpot, and cook the soup at a simmer for 45 minutes. Stir the zucchini and beans into the soup; cook another 10 minutes.",
