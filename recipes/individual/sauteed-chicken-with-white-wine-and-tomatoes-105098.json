        "Have a 4-pound chicken cut into serving pieces, wipe them dry, season them with salt and pepper, and dip them lightly in flour. In a broad saut\u00e9 or frying pan brown them on all sides in 1/4 cup of hot olive oil. Add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion and let it cook slowly until it is golden. Add 1/2 cup of dry white wine and cook until this is reduced by about half. Then add 4 medium-size tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped coarse, 1 small clove of garlic, chopped and mashed, and 1 tablespoon of finely minced parsley. Cover the pan and cook the chicken slowly for 15 to 20 minutes. Five minutes before it is done, add a dozen pitted black Italian olives. Serve with steamed potatoes."
