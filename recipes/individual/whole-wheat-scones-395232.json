        "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and use your fingers to pinch the butter and the flour mixture together; when it's all combined, it will resemble large bread crumbs.",
        "2. Use a wooden spoon to mix in the brown sugar and raisins, and then add the buttermilk. If the dough is quite sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough has the texture of modeling clay. If it's too dry, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it's wet enough.",
        "3. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and roll it out into a rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into 12 (3-inch) squares. Leftover scraps can be rerolled to make more scones.",
        "4. Oil a baking sheet. Fold each square of dough in half diagonally to form a triangle, and lay it on the sheet. Bake the scones until the tops are golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve warm, with jam and a pot of hot tea if you like."
