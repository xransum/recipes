        "Return half of potato mixture to wide pot; reserve remaining potato mixture in bowl. Add Gruy\u00e8re and mozzarella and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until cheese is melted and mixture can be stretched with the spoon (like warm mozzarella), about 10 minutes. Transfer to gratin dish; smooth top.",
        "Working in batches if needed, spoon reserved potato mixture in bowl into pastry bag fitted with star tip. Pipe very tight rows of 1/2x1/2\" rosettes on potato-cheese mixture in gratin dish. Bake until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving."
