Arrange spinach leaves in 1 layer on 1 of the pieces of turkey and top with a layer of feta cheese. Repeat layering with spinach and feta cheese. Fold the other turkey breast half over the feta layer so the filling is sealed. Wrap the entire turkey breast with bacon. Place wrapped turkey in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper.",

        "Turn on oven's broiler and broil wrapped turkey until bacon is crisp on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Let turkey rest for 10 minutes before slicing."
