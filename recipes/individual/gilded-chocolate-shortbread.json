        "In a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream the butter and 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar. Beat in the cocoa, vanilla and salt, mix until smooth. On low speed, gradually mix in the flour until fully incorporated. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Prepare a clean, dry  work surface by dusting with the remaining confectioners' sugar.",
        "Roll chilled dough out to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into shapes with a knife or cookie cutters. Place cookies onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Using a small stiff brush or flat pastry brush, lightly dust the tops of the cookies with the 24-karat gold dust. Bake cookies for 12 to 15 minutes, or until firm. Be careful not to overbake; you cannot tell by looking because of the dark color of the dough. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before moving to a wire rack to cool completely."
