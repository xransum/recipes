        "Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan with a lid over medium heat. Cook and stir the bacon pieces until lightly browned and the oil has a bacon flavor, about 1 minute. Remove the bacon from the pan, turn the heat to high, stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic cloves are beginning to turn golden brown, about 1 more minute. Add the chicken pieces, stirring to seal the surfaces of the meat. Turn the heat down, and cook until golden brown on the outside but still pink on the inside, about 3 minutes.",
        "Return the bacon pieces to the pan, and stir in the dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, and rice, and mix everything together until well-combined. Pour in the water (should not reach to the top of the rice mixture), cover the pan, and turn the heat to low. Simmer until the rice is cooked and grains of roasted rice are stuck on the bottom of the pan, about 30 minutes. Serve each portion topped with some of the browned rice kernels scraped from the bottom."
