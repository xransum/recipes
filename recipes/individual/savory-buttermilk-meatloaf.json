  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.",
    "Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until soft and translucent, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool to room temperature.",
    "Combine cooled onion, beef chuck, bread crumbs, buttermilk, ketchup, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, hot sauce, tarragon, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; mix together with a fork and let sit until breadcrumbs absorb moisture, about 10 minutes.",
    "Turn meatloaf mixture out into the center of the prepared baking sheet and form into a 9x5-inch loaf.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. While meatloaf is baking, whisk brown sugar, mustard, and cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Spread brown sugar glaze over the top of the meatloaf and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
