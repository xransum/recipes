        "Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill. Place a perforated steel saut\u00e9 pan and a perforated steel chef\u2019s pan on the grill and preheat for 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "In a bowl, stir together the steak and 1 Tbs. of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. In another bowl, stir together the bell peppers, red onion, broccoli and 2 Tbs. of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. In another bowl, stir together the squash, zucchini and the remaining 2 Tbs. oil, and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Add half the beef to the chef\u2019s pan, cover the grill and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat to cook the remaining beef.",
        "Meanwhile, add the bell pepper mixture to the saut\u00e9 pan, place the lid on the pan, cover the grill and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, adding the water halfway through the cooking time. Add the squash mixture to the saut\u00e9 pan and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are crisp-tender, 5 to 6 minutes more.",
        "Transfer all the vegetables and the beef to the chef\u2019s pan, add the 3/4 cup hibachi barbecue sauce and stir to coat evenly. Cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes, adding the green onions during the last 30 seconds.",
        "Transfer the beef and vegetables to a warmed platter. Serve immediately with steamed rice and pass additional barbecue sauce at the table for drizzling. Serves 6."
