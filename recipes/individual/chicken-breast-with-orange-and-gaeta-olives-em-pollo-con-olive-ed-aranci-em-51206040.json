        "In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and lightly dredge it in flour. Lightly brown the chicken in the skillet (you want the chicken to end up with a blond-colored crust) on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Cook the chicken in batches if necessary, depending on the size of your skillet. Remove pieces to a plate as they color.",
        "Once the chicken is colored, add the butter and onion and cook until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the olives, orange juice and zest, white wine, and fennel powder. Put chicken back in the skillet, and simmer until the chicken is just cooked through and the sauce coats the chicken, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season with remaining salt, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve."
