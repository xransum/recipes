    "Place the cranberries and water into a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook just until the berries pop, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand at room temperature until cold, several hours.",
    "Strain out the cranberries and stir the orange juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice and sugar into the liquid. Add the cinnamon stick, whole cloves and allspice berries. Bring to a low boil. It is ready to serve at this point, but it is even better if you allow it to sit overnight."
