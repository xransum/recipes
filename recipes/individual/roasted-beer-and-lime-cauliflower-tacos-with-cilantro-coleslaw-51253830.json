        "Cut the cabbage into the thinnest strips you can and make sure those pieces are no longer than 2 inches. This is a great time to get good with your knife if you are looking for a silver fking lining in all that chopping. Chop the carrot into thin matchsticks of the same length. Got that st down now, right? In a small bowl, mix together the lime juice, vinegar, oil, and salt. Add the dressing right before you are going to eat and toss that s**t well. Fold in the cilantro just before serving.",
        "Crank your oven to 400\u00b0F. Chop the cauliflower into small florets no bigger than a quarter. In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the beer, broth, lime juice, tamari, hot sauce, and garlic. Add the cauliflower and simmer for about 90 seconds. Drain.",
        "In a large bowl. toss the spices, salt, and olive oil together. Add the cauliflower and onion and stir 'til those f**kers are coated. Dump it on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until browned, stirring halfway, about 20 minutes.",
        "To assemble the tacos, warm the tortillas in the oven or microwave for a hot minute and then pile them high with the cauliflower filling, slices of avocado, some of the slaw, and top with plenty of salsa."
