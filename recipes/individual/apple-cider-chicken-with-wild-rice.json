        "While they reduce, mix the chicken broth and the cornstarch until there are no lumps left, then slowly add it to the bubbling cider and apples, stirring all the time while the sauce thickens.",
        "Mix in thyme, mustard, salt and pepper.",
        "Return the chicken and its juices back into the sauce, turn down to medium-low and summer for at least 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked all the way through. Serve with hot cooked rice."
