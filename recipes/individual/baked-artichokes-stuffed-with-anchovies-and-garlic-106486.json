        "Place bread in medium bowl. Pour warm water over; soak 5 minutes. Drain, then squeeze bread dry. Return bread to same bowl. Add 1/2 cup oil, purchased breadcrumbs, mint, capers, anchovies, and chopped garlic; blend well. Season stuffing with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Fill large bowl with water. Squeeze in juice from lemon. Cut off all but 1 1/2 inches of stem from 1 artichoke. Peel stem with vegetable peeler. Starting at bottom of artichoke, snap off outer 3 rows of leaves. Cut off top 1/3 of artichoke. Spread leaves, exposing center. Remove center leaves and bristly choke. Place artichoke in lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.",
