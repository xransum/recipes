        "In a large bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  Add  the sugar gradually to the egg whites, beating all the while.  Add in the whipped butter.  The frosting may clump at this point if the butter is at all chilled.  Don't worry, it just means that the frosting will require more beating.  Beat until smooth.",
