        "In a large saucepan saut\u00e9 the onion, the garlic, and the bell pepper in the oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until the vegetables begin to brown. Add the chicken, the sausage, the tomatoes with the juice, the wine, the or\u00e9gano, the basil, and the sugar and boil the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. While the mixture is boiling, in a kettle of boiling salted water boil the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it well. To the tomato mixture add the cream and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the sauce for 3 minutes, or until it is thickened slightly. Divide the spaghetti between 2 plates and spoon the sauce over it."
