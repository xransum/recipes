Roll out each piece, stretching the dough if necessary, into a 6- to 8-inch round. Carefully transfer the rounds to the prepared pan. The dough is elastic and will tend to lose shape; use oiled fingertips to reform the rounds on the pan, stretching and pulling the dough as needed. Brush with olive oil. Bake until the rounds are puffed and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven. Leave the oven on.",
