        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast pecans and walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling pan occasionally and scraping bottom with a wooden spoon, until butter turns caramel-brown and smells nutty, about 5 minutes.",
        "Add corn syrup, maple syrup, orange zest and juice, vanilla, and salt, whisk to combine, and bring to a simmer. Add pecans and walnuts and continue to simmer until liquid is thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve warm or cool.",
        "Nuts can be made 5 days ahead; store in an airtight container and chill. Rewarm in a microwave for 45 seconds on high or in a saucepan over medium heat."
