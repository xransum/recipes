        "In a large bowl proof the yeast with the sugar in 3/4 cup warm water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. In a small saucepan melt the butter, add the milk, and heat the mixture to lukewarm. Add the milk mixture to the yeast mixture with 3 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt. Stir the dough until it forms a ball, turn it out onto a floured surface, and knead it, incorporating as much of the remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, put it in a buttered large bowl, and turn it to coat it with the butter. Let the dough rise, covered, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it into a 21- by 14-inch rectangle. In a small bowl combine well 1/4 cup of the mustard and honey, spread the mixture over the dough, and sprinkle the dough with the M\u00fcnster. Cover the M\u00fcnster with the ham and, starting with a long side, roll up the dough tightly, jelly-roll fashion. Trim the ends of the dough, cut the roll crosswise with a sharp knife into 16 equal pieces and transfer the pieces, cut sides up, to 16 well-buttered 1/2-cup muffin tins, pressing them in slightly. Let the buns rise, covered, in a warm place for 45 minutes, or until they are almost double in bulk, and bake them in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 30 minutes, or until they are golden. Run a knife around the buns, lifting them out of the tins, and let the buns cool upside down on a rack. (The buns may be made 1 day in advance and kept wrapped well and chilled.) Serve the buns warm or at room temperature with the chutney and the additional mustard."
