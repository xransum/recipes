        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook chicken breast halves until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Pour in chicken stock, artichoke hearts, pearl onions, thyme, salt, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until stock is reduced and onions and artichokes are tender, about 45 minutes; turn chicken breasts over in the skillet after 20 minutes.",

Spoon about 3 tablespoons liquid from skillet into a small bowl and whisk in cornstarch until smooth; stir cornstarch mixture into skillet and cook until sauce has thickened, about 1 minute. Serve pan sauce with chicken breasts."
