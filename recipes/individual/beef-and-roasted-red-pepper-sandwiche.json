        "Place under the broiler, about 6 inches from the heat source. Broil until the cheese melts, and the edges of the rolls are lightly toasted. Place roll halves together to make sandwiches.",
        "Pour leftover au jus into small cups for each person - I like to use custard cups. Serve with sandwiches for dipping."
