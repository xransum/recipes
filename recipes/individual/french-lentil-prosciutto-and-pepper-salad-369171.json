        "In a medium saut\u00e9 pan or frying pan, heat the 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the prosciutto and saut\u00e9 until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the shallots and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the carrots and bell pepper/capsicum and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Set aside.",
        "In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils with at least 4 cups/960 ml salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils are just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl. Add the prosciutto mixture, along with the parsley and thyme; toss to combine.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard. Gradually whisk in the 1/3 cup/75 ml olive oil until emulsified. Add the salt and pepper. Toss the lentil salad with the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning."
