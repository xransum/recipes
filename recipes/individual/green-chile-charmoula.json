        "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill scallions and chiles, turning occasionally with tongs, until lightly charred and blistered in spots but crisp-tender, about 2 minutes for scallions and about 5 minutes for chiles. Transfer to a cutting board. Let cool slightly, then chop and place in a small bowl. Add basil, cilantro, oil, and ground spices to scallions and chiles and mix well; season with salt and pepper.",
