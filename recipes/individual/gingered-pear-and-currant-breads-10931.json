        "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the salt, and the cinnamon. In a small bowl toss together the pears and the lemon juice. In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the brown sugar and beat in the vanilla and the eggs, 1 at a time. Add the ginger and the pear mixture and beat the mixture until it is combined well. Beat in the flour mixture and beat the mixture until it is just combined. Stir in the currants, divide the batter among 4 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2 inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until they are pale golden and a tester comes out clean. Remove the breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month."
