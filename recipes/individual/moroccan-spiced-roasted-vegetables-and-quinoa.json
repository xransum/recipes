        "In a bowl, toss the parsnips and carrots with 2 Tbs. of the olive oil, the cumin, turmeric and cinnamon. Spread the vegetables in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and season well with salt and pepper. Roast, stirring a couple of times, until the vegetables are very tender and caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a saucepan over high heat, bring the broth to a boil. Add the quinoa, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until all the broth is absorbed, about 12 minutes.",
        "Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl and add the roasted vegetables, apricots, almonds and parsley. Stir in the remaining 4 Tbs. (2 fl. oz./60 ml) olive oil, season with salt and pepper and serve. Serves 4 to 6.",
