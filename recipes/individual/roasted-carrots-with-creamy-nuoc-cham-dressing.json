  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss carrots and 2 Tbsp. oil on a large rimmed baking sheet and season with salt. Roast, tossing occasionally, until crisp-tender, 20–25 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, bring shallot, chiles, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, sugar, and 2 Tbsp. water to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook just until aromatics are soft, 8–10 minutes (you don’t want the liquid to reduce much). Let cool. Transfer to a blender, add lime juice and mayonnaise, and blend until smooth. With motor running, gradually stream in remaining 1/4 cup oil; blend until emulsified. Season dressing with salt.",
    "Drizzle dressing over carrots just before serving.",
    "Dressing can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill."
