        "Wash the potato slices well and dry them on a towel. Pour a thin layer of heavy cream on the bottom of a 9\" by 12\" baking dish and alternate layers of potatoes and cheese.Top with cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover with foil and place in a pan of hot water. Bake at 350\u00b0F. until the potatoes are just tender. If all the cream has been absorbed, add more. Remove from pan of water, take off foil and replace in the oven to brown lightly. Just before serving, sprinkle with cheese and brown again. This is delicious served with baby lamb."
