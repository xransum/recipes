  "directions": [
    "Trim asparagus, then cut stems into 1/4-inch-thick diagonal slices, leaving tips whole.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté asparagus, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate, reserving skillet off heat (do not clean).",
    "Pat scallops dry and sprinkle with pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté half of scallops, turning over once, until browned and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer scallops with tongs to another plate as cooked.",

    "Carefully add wine and vinegar to skillet (mixture may spatter) and boil, scraping up brown bits, until liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 1 minute. Add any scallop juices accumulated on plate and bring to a simmer.",
    "Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated.",
    "Add asparagus and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.",
