        "Discard coarse stems from spinach. Wash leaves well and drain in a colander. In a large heavy kettle steam spinach with water clinging to leaves, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain spinach in colander, pressing out as much liquid as possible with back of a large spoon. Return spinach to kettle and cook in butter with salt and pepper to taste, uncovered, over moderate heat, stirring, 30 seconds.",
        "Brush a 12-inch non-stick skillet lightly with oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Remove skillet from heat. Working quickly, stir batter and fill a 1/4-cup measure. Pour batter into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom. Cook cr\u00eape over moderately high heat until bottom is golden and top appears almost dry, about 1 minute. Turn cr\u00eape over and put one-fourth spinach in center. Fold in edge of cr\u00eape to form a square, leaving spinach in center exposed, and cook cr\u00eape 30 seconds, or until bottom is golden. Slide cr\u00eape onto a large baking sheet.",
        "Keep cr\u00eape warm in oven while making 3 more cr\u00eapes with remaining batter and spinach in same manner.",
        "Brush skillet lightly with oil and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Break eggs, 1 at a time, into skillet and cook until whites are set, about 2 minutes. Top each cr\u00eape with an egg and 1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream."
