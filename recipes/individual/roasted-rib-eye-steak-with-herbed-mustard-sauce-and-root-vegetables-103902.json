Rub steak with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place steak on small baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables 40 minutes. Place steak in oven. Roast vegetables until tender and beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, and roast steak until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare. Let steak stand 3 minutes. Thinly slice crosswise. Divide between 2 plates. Arrange roasted vegetables alongside. Serve, passing mustard sauce separately."
