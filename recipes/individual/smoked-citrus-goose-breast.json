        "Whisk together the orange juice, olive oil, mustard, sugar, soy sauce, honey, onion, and garlic powder in a bowl; place the goose in the marinade; cover and refrigerate 3 to 6 hours.",
        "Preheat a smoker for medium heat, about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). If you do not have a smoker, prepare a grill for indirect heat. Once the coals are ready, throw a handful of the soaked hickory wood chips on to create smoke.",
        "Place the goose breasts on the grate. Brush occasionally with the marinade for the first 30 minutes, then discard any unused marinade. Continue to cook until the juices run clear and reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes longer."
