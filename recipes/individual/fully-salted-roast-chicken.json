  "directions": [
    "Pat dry chicken with paper towels. Holding a 5-finger pinch of salt and positioning your hand at least 10\" above chicken, evenly rain salt down over chicken. Repeat with several more pinches of salt until both inside and outside of chicken are covered with salt (be generous and make sure to get inside all the nooks and crannies). Place chicken on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and chill uncovered at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.",
    "Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.",
    "Preheat oven to 425°F. Roast chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken thigh registers 165°F, 40–55 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before carving.",
    "Divide pasta among bowls and top with chervil, if desired."
