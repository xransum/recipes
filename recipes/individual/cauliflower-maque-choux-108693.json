        "Meanwhile, heat butter and 2 tablespoons strained oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook ham (if using), stirring, 2 minutes. Add onion and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add vinegar and stock and simmer briskly, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by about half, 12 to 15 minutes.",
