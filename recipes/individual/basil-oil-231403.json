    "directions": [
        "To make an oil with the brightest green result, blanch the basil, spinach, and parsley in boiling salted water for 45 seconds, then drain, immediately shock in ice water (this sets the color), and drain again. Squeeze to extract any excess water, then chop the greens coarsely. If you are adhering to a strict raw diet, omit this step and simply chop the raw greens coarsely. In a high-speed blender, combine the chopped greens and olive and canola oils and process for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mixture is bright green. Pour into a container with a tight-fitting lid, cover, and refrigerate for 1 day.",
        "The next day, strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the solids. Return to the container and refrigerate for 1 day, then decant and use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 1 week."
