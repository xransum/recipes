        "Place brisket on a work surface and pound firmly with the textured side of a meat mallet to break down the fibers. Place brisket, onion, lemon zest, cloves and bay leaf in a bowl. Pour vinegar and water over brisket. Cover and refrigerate, turning in the marinade daily, for 3 days.",
        "Remove brisket from marinade, reserving marinade. Wrap brisket in overlapping bacon strips to cover completely; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook wrapped brisket until bacon is browned, about 5 minutes per side. Pour marinade into pan to cover half of the brisket; sprinkle carrot and parsley on top. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook brisket, turning occasionally and adding beef stock as liquid evaporates, until very tender, 2 to 3 hours. Slice brisket and arrange on a warm serving platter."
