        "Cook pasta according to package directions, but before draining, reserve 1/2 cup cooking water. While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt and cook, stirring frequently, 2 or 3 minutes or until mushrooms are soft. Add garlic and cook another 2 or 3 minutes until garlic is soft and most of the liquid has evaporated. Toss pasta with mushrooms, arugula, and goat cheese. Stir in reserved cooking liquid until cheese becomes creamy. Toss in parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper."
