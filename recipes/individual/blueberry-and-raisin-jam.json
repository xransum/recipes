        "Blend raisins and orange juice in a blender or food processor until smooth; transfer mixture to a pot. Blend blueberries in blender or food processor until pureed; add to raisin mixture. Stir pectin into fruit mixture and bring to a boil. Mix sugar into fruit mixture; boil, stirring often, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 more minutes.",
        "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for 10 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool dark area."
