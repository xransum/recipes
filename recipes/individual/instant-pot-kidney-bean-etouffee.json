    "For the sauté, use the sauté setting over normal, or medium heat, and heat the oil or broth. Add the onion and sauté until transparent, 5 minutes. Then add the bell pepper and garlic. Sauté until the bell peppers soften, 5 minutes longer.",
    "For the pressure cooker, add the water, beans, bay leaves, thyme, smoked paprika, marjoram and cayenne to the onion mixture and stir to combine. Put the lid on and make sure the steam release handle is set to sealing, or closed; change to the manual setting (the pressure cooking one) and set the timer for 15 minutes.",
    "Carefully manually release the pressure. Remove the bay leaves.",
    "Before serving, mix in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, liquid smoke and ground bay leaf (if using). Then add salt and pepper to taste. Cook the stew for an additional 3 minutes on high pressure, then release the pressure naturally.",
    "Serve over steamed rice with a side of your favorite hot sauce. I love garlic Tabasco myself."
