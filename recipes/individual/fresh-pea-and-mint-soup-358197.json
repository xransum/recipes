Cook until peas are very tender, about 8 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Puree soup and 1/4 cup chopped mint in batches in blender until smooth. Return to same pot; thin with more broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover, and chill.",

        "A bottle of bubbly is the perfect way to begin this special meal. It's also a great pairing for the soup. We like the crisp acidity and long finish of the Champagne Henriot NV Brut Souverain ($35, France)."
