Using electric mixer, beat yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until pale yellow and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon peel. Using clean dry beaters, beat whites and salt in another bowl until medium peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into yolk mixture in 2 additions. Gently fold in coconut mixture. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen cake. Slide cake on parchment onto rack; cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Return cake to pan. Cover with plastic; store at room temperature.)",
