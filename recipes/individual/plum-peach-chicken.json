        "Place 3 plums and 1 peach into the work bowl of a food processor with the juice drink, red pepper flakes, paprika, and cinnamon; process until smooth. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper; place into the prepared baking dish. Pour about 3/4 of the fruit sauce over the chicken. Set the remaining sauce aside.",
        "Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the sauce has thickened and baked onto the meat, the chicken is no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
        "Place each chicken breast on a plate and spoon the reserved fruit sauce over the chicken. Place 1 chopped plum and 1 chopped peach into a bowl, and mix the fruit together; garnish each chicken breast with 1/3 of the chopped fruit."
