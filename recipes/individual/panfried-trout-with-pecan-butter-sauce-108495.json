        "Add oil and 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and heat over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saut\u00e9 both trout, gently turning over once using 2 spatulas, until golden brown and almost cooked through, about 8 minutes total (fish will continue to cook as it stands). Transfer each trout to a plate and keep warm in oven.",

Add parsley, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, swirling skillet to combine, and remove from heat. Add lemon juice, swirling skillet to incorporate, and spoon over trout. Serve immediately."
