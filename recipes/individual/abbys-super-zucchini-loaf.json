  "directions": [
    "Soak raisins in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander or strainer; set aside.",
    "Clean the zucchini and trim off the ends. Do not peel. Shred with a medium sized shredder. You should have about 4 cups when finished. Sprinkle the zucchini with 1 teaspoon of the salt and place on a plate. Mix it with your hands to evenly distribute the salt. Place a heavy saucepan on top of the zucchini and allow it to sit for 20 minutes to purge itself of liquid.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans and set aside.",
    "Set aside 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sift together the remaining flour, soda, spices, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
    "Beat eggs on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the sugar, a little at a time and beat for a good 5 minutes. The mixture should be light in color and thick. While beating, slowly pour in the oil.",
    "Empty the zucchini into a colander and squeeze to release the juices.",
    "Add the vanilla to the beating eggs and then add in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients, a little at a time and mix just until the dry ingredients are mixed in. Do not overmix.",
    "In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 tablespoons flour, nuts, and drained raisins, and mix together to coat. Fold into the batter. Pour into the prepared pans.",
    "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) about 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on a rack completely."
