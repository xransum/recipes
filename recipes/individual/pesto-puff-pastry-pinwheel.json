        "Cut the circle, away from the glass, into 4 equal quarters. Cut each quarter in half, then each eighth in half, to make 16 equal strips. Remove glass. Twist strips twice, two at a time, in the opposite direction. Pinch ends together. Repeat with remaining strips to make a pinwheel shape.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is browned, 25 to 30 minutes."
