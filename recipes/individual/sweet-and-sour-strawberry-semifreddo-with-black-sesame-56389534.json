        "Cook strawberries and sugar in a medium pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until strawberries have broken down into a thick, chunky jam (they should not be syrupy), 10\u201315 minutes. Stir in vinegar; let cool.",
        "Meanwhile, toast black sesame seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool. Whip cream and salt until cream holds a medium-stiff peak. Gently whisk in sweetened condensed milk and yogurt until completely blended. Gently fold in half of strawberry jam, just enough to create streaks, then gently fold in remaining jam (mixture should look marbled with pockets of jam).",
        "Transfer to a medium bowl or loaf pan and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.",
        "Serve semifreddo topped with toasted sesame seeds."
