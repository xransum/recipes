    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.",
    "Mix white sugar, butter, and flour together in a large bowl until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well after each addition. Whisk corn syrup and vanilla extract into sugar mixture; fold in pecans.",
    "Roll pie crust pastry onto a floured work surface; cut into circles using end of a drinking glass or a biscuit cutter. This will make 11 crusts. Roll the scraps into a ball and roll back onto the floured surface; cut 1 more circle. Press each circle into the prepared muffin cups. Repeat with remaining pie crust pastry.",
    "Spoon pecan mixture, about 2 tablespoons per pie, into pie crust pastry.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 18 minutes. Allow tarts to cool in muffin tins for 5 minutes before loosening edges from sides of tin; let rest 5 minutes more. Transfer tarts to a wire rack to cool completely."
