        "Whisk olive oil, onion, garlic, chili powder, balsamic vinegar, lime juice, molasses, paprika, onion powder, cumin, cilantro, black pepper, and sage together in a shallow baking dish until marinade is thick and well-combined. Place steaks in marinade and turn to coat completely. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature to marinate meat, about 15 minutes.",
        "Cook the steaks on the preheated grill, basting frequently with marinade, until steaks start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove steaks to a plate and let rest for 3 minutes before slicing."
