    "Preheat an oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
    "In a food processor, combine the butter, rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley, garlic and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Pulse until the mixture is creamy and the garlic is minced and blended into the butter.",
    "Place the beef tenderloin on the prepared baking sheet. Using a silicone spatula, rub the herb butter over the entire surface of the meat.",
    "Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, 40 to 45 minutes, or until done to your liking. Transfer the tenderloin to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the crème fraîche, horseradish and a pinch of salt.",
    "Cut the tenderloin into slices and arrange on a platter. Serve with the horseradish crème fraîche. Serves 8 to 10.",
