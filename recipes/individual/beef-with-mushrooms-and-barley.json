        "Put the dried mushrooms in a bowl, add the boiling water and soak for 20 minutes. Line a fine-mesh sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth, place over a bowl and drain the mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid. Rinse the mushrooms with cold water and chop finely.",
        "Preheat an oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C).",
        "In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Working in batches, sear the beef, turning frequently, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Add the onions and garlic to the pot and saut\u00e9 until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the rehydrated mushrooms. Add the fresh mushrooms, reduce the heat to medium, and saut\u00e9 until they start to brown and release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushroom soaking liquid and the broth. Return the beef to the pot and stir to combine. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook until the beef is tender, about 2 hours.",
        "Stir in the barley and water. Cover and cook in the oven for 1 hour. Stir in the carrots and parsnips. Cover and cook in the oven until the barley and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with the dill and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.",
