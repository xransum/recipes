        "In food processor, pulse cheese and jalapeno together until finely chopped. Add flour, mustard and pepper. Pulse just to combine. Add butter; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with butter the size of peas. Pour in 3 tablespoons (45mL) of ice water. Pulse just until dough starts to hold together, adding up to 1 tablespoon (15mL) more water if dough seems dry. Shape into disc. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, 2 hours or for up to 24 hours. (Disc can be frozen for up to 2 months; thaw in fridge before rolling.)",

        "Bake in centre of oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Cool in pan on rack for 5 minutes. Transfer to racks to cool completely."
