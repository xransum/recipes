    "In a bowl stir together tomatoes, coriander, shallots, zest, lemon juice, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Drain mixture in a sieve set over a bowl 10 minutes, reserving liquid, and divide among toasts, spreading to cover.",

In a large non-stick skillet heat butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and cook fish 3 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. Arrange 1 fillet over each bruschetta and keep warm. Add reserved tomato liquid and orange juice to skillet and boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Pour sauce over fish."
