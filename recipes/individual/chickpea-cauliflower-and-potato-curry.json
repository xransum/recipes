        "In a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion, chilies, ginger and cumin seeds and saut\u00e9 until the onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add the chickpeas with their liquid, tomatoes with their juices, lime juice, 1/2 tsp. of the garam masala and the turmeric. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to blend the flavors.",
        "Add the cauliflower, potatoes and the 1 cup water and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes, adding more water if the mixture becomes dry. Stir in the remaining 1/4 tsp. garam masala. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Divide the rice among 4 warmed shallow bowls. Spoon the curry over the top, sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
        "Quick Tips:",
        "Garam masala, an aromatic Indian spice blend, can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets. It\u2019s a terrific seasoning to have on hand in the cupboard to add flavor to chicken, fish, potatoes and sweet potatoes. This stew reheats well, so it can be served again a night or two later. Canned chickpeas are a versatile staple; they are great in salads, stews and soups.",
