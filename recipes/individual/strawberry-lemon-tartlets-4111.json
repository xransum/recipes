        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out crust on lightly floured surface to 16-inch round (scant 1/8 inch thick). Cut out 3-inch rounds. Gather and re-roll dough scraps. Cut out enough rounds to make 16 total. Line 3-inch-diameter fluted tartlet pans with -inch-high sides with dough rounds. Freeze crusts 15 minutes.",
        "Arrange tartlet pans on large baking sheets. Bake crusts until pale golden, piercing bottoms with toothpick if crusts bubble, about 13 minutes. Cool crusts completely. Turn crusts out of pans; arrange on platter.",
        "Whisk lemon curd and lemon peel in medium bowl until smooth. Whip cream in another medium bowl until soft peaks form. Fold cream into lemon curd in 2 additions. Divide filling among crusts. Cut each strawberry as desired and place 1 atop each tartlet.",
        "Stir preserves and brandy in small saucepan over medium heat until mixture comes to boil. Strain into small bowl. Brush each berry with glaze. Garnish tartlets with lemon peel, if desired. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover loosely and refrigerate.)"
