  "directions": [
    "Combine curry powder, Thai chili garlic sauce, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and soy sauce in a small bowl, and set aside. Fill a saucepan with water, and bring it to a boil. When the water is boiling, drop in the spaghetti and cook for 8 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Drain the spaghetti, and set aside.",
    "Heat peanut oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat until barely smoking, and drop in the chicken. Cook and stir 5 to 8 minutes, until the chicken is just beginning to brown and the inside is no longer pink. Remove chicken from the skillet, and set aside.",
    "Make the peanut sauce by stirring together peanut butter and 3 1/2 cups of water in a saucepan over medium heat until mixture is smooth and the peanut butter is melted. Pour in the curry-chili sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes.",
    "To serve, place the noodles in a large bowl, top with chicken, and spoon the peanut sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle the green onions over the dish, and garnish with chow mein noodles."
