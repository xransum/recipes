        "In a large heavy skillet cook the sausage over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up the lumps, until it is cooked through and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Add the oil to the skillet, in the fat cook the onion and the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, and in a bowl stir together the sausage, the onion mixture, the Feta, the red peppers, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the bread crumbs, the parsley, the eggs, and salt and pepper to taste.",
        "On a work surface arrange 1 strip of the phyllo with a short side facing you, brush it lightly with some of the butter, and put 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling about 1 inch from the bottom end of the strip. Fold the lower right corner of the strip up over the filling, forming a triangle of the folded phyllo, continue to fold the filled triangle up the entire length of the strip, and brush the triangle lightly with some of the butter. Form more triangles in the same manner with the remaining phyllo, filling, and butter, transferring them to baking sheets as they are formed. The triangles may be made 1 week in advance and kept frozen in airtight containers. Do not thaw the triangles before baking. Bake the triangles in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden."
