    "Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl. Stir in the syrup and eggs. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture; knead into a stiff dough. Pat into a flat circle, and wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.",
