        "Whisk together the mashed bananas, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and buttermilk. Stir the cornmeal mixture into the banana mixture, and let the batter rest until the couscous absorbs some of the moisture, about 5 minutes. Spoon the batter into ungreased muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full.",
