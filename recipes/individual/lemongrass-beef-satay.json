        "Cut the beef into small cubes. In a bowl, combine the lemongrass, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, honey, salt and pepper to make a paste. Add the beef and toss to coat, then cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. Soak 30 wooden skewers in water to cover for 30 minutes.",
        "Position a broiler rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler.",
        "Drain the skewers. Divide the beef among the skewers, pushing the cubes fairly tightly together to prevent them from drying out. Place the assembled skewers on the broiler pan and broil, turning every 2 minutes with tongs, for 8 to 10 minutes total.",
        "Meanwhile, stack the lettuce leaves and finely slice them crosswise. Make a bed of the shredded lettuce on a platter.",
        "Transfer the satay to the platter. At this point, the satay can be held for about 15 minutes before serving. Serve with the peanut sauce for dipping. Serves 8 to 10.",
