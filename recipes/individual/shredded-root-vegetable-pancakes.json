        "Place the grated root veggies and onion in a large kitchen towel and wring out any liquid, then add them to a medium bowl.",
        "Stir in the egg whites. Stir in the flour, salt, and pepper to taste.",
        "In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the oil over medium-high heat. Use a scant 1/4 cup measure to scoop pancakes into the skillet, using the bottom of the measuring cup to spread the mixture into 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until the first side is deeply golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes, then turn the pancakes over and brown the other side, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the pancakes to a wire rack to cool slightly. Work in batches so you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan, adding more oil to the pan as needed.",
        "Serve the pancakes topped with a few pinches of flaky sea salt, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of scallions.",
        "If you want these guys a little spicy, mince 1/2 a jalape\u00f1o or Fresno chile and add it to the mixture before frying."
