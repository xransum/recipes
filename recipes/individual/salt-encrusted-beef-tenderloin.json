        "Whisk egg whites and water in separate bowl until well blended; stir into flour mixture (sprinkle with additional water if dough is too stiff to knead). Knead on lightly floured surface for 2 to 3 minutes. Place in bowl or plastic food storage bag; cover and let stand at room temperature for 4 (or up to 24) hours.",

        "Sprinkle remaining herbs over tenderloin, pressing lightly. Place beef in center of dough. Bring sides of dough together to encase beef; crimp to seal. Fold and crimp ends to enclose beef. Carefully place on large baking sheet. Roast about 25 to 35 minutes or until internal temperature of beef reaches 135 to 145 degrees F, depending on desired doneness (temperature will rise as roast stands). Remove from oven and let stand 10 to 15 minutes.",
