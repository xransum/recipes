        "In a bowl with an electric mixer beat whites until they just hold soft peaks and gradually beat in sugar until meringue holds stiff peaks. Coarsely grate bananas onto meringue and gently fold with chocolate chips into meringue.",
        "Arrange ramekins on a baking sheet and divide mixture evenly among them, mounding it in centers. Run a knife around sides of ramekins, freeing mixture to aid rising, and bake souffl\u00e9s in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
        "Serve souffl\u00e9s immediately."
