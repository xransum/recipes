        "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Spread oats, almonds, pecans, and sunflower seeds in an even layer in a large shallow baking pan and bake, stirring occasionally, until oats are pale golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss with pumpkin seeds and zest.",
        "Line a baking sheet with nonstick liner. Cook brown sugar, syrup, juice, and salt in a 4- to 6-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon (be careful not to splash or splatter while stirring; mixture will become extremely hot), until it registers 290\u00b0F on thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in butter until melted (mixture will thicken and become opaque), then quickly add nut mixture and stir until coated well. Immediately pour onto liner, then cover mixture with a sheet of parchment paper.",
        "Roll out brittle as thin as possible with a rolling pin. Carefully peel off parchment paper and discard (don't worry if some caramel sticks to parchment).",
        "Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Break brittle into large pieces."
