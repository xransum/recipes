Add the shallots, carrots and bell pepper and saut\u00e9, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown and soften slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the turkey and stir until the meat turns white and begins to color very slightly around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the herbes de Provence and stir for 1 minute.",
        "Add the broth, tomatoes and rice and bring to a boil. Stir in the kale and season with 3/4 tsp. of the salt and the pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Season with the remaining 1/4 tsp. salt.",
        "Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with the parsley and cheese and serve. Serves 4.",
