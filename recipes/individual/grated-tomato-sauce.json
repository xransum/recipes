        "Slice a thin round off the bottom of each tomato. Starting at cut end, grate tomatoes on the largest holes of a grater over a medium bowl until all that\u2019s left is the flattened tomato skin and stem; discard. Season grated flesh with several generous pinches of salt.",
        "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook garlic, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add rosemary and cook, tossing, just until fragrant and starting to brown around edges, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low, add tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until mixture is slightly thickened, 5\u201310 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Taste and season with more salt as needed.",
        "Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill."
