        "Mix the rice flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and the water together in a bowl into a soft dough; set aside.",
        "Stir 1/2 cup sugar and sesame seeds together in a small bowl. Toss the coconut with the salt together in a separate bowl.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.",
        "Take a portion of the soft dough and roll it into a ball between the palms of your hands. Pull lengthwise and shape into a tongue. Drop into the boiling water. The cake is ready when it floats. Scoop it out with a strainer and roll it in the sugar and sesame seed mixture. Place it on a serving platter. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Top the cakes with coconut and serve warm."
