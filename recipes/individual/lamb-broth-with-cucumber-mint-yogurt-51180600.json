        "Put all the ingredients into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 3\u20144 minutes and skim off the froth that forms on the surface, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 1 1/2\u20142 hours, until the lamb is tender and almost falling off the bone, then remove from the heat.",
        "Remove the shank from the stock, then pass the stock through a fine strainer or sieve into a clean saucepan (discard the vegetables) and keep hot. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Shred the lamb meat from the bone.",
        "To serve, divide the shredded lamb meat among 6 soup bowls. Gather the cucumber strips into 6 bundles and add one to each bowl, then pour over the hot stock and add a tablespoon of yogurt. Finish with a few mint sprigs and a grinding of black pepper. Serve immediately."
