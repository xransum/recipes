        "In a large bowl, combine the oranges and the wine and chill the mixture, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for 5 days. Discard the oranges, add the sugar and the Cognac, and stir the mixture until the sugar is dissolved. Strain the mixture through a sieve lined with a double thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth into a bowl and pour the wine into decorative bottles with corks. Insert a strip of the orange zest into each bottle and chill the wine, corked, for one week. The wine keeps, chilled for 3 months."
