        "Position rack in middle of oven and preheat to 425\u00b0F. Whisk sugar, baking powder, kosher salt, baking soda, and 3 cups flour in a large bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter or 2 butter knives until pea-sized lumps form. Stir in buttermilk until a shaggy dough forms.",
        "Gather dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, press into an 8\" square. Fold sides over like a letter. Turn 90\u00ba and fold sides again, forming a small square. Press or roll to an 8\" square and repeat once, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.",
        "Pat dough into a scant 3/4\" round. Cut out rounds with 2 1/2\" cutter; transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Gather scraps and repeat patting and cutting (you should have 14). Freeze until chilled, about 15 minutes.",
        "Bake biscuits, rotating sheet halfway through, until golden brown, 22\u201324 minutes.",
        "Stir butter, honey, and 2 tsp. sea salt in a medium bowl until well combined.",
        "Top biscuits with Honey Butter and sprinkle with sea salt; serve warm or at room temperature."
