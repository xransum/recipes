        "Remove cookies from oven and sprinkle each mint with 1/2 teaspoon coconut (for lettuce).  Place another vanilla wafer on top and press gentle.  With a clean paint brush, brush the top of each hamburger with just enough water to moisten so that the sesame seeds will stick when sprinkled on top of each cookie.  NOTE:  You can use canned chocolate frosting in place of peppermint patty, then eliminate the baking."
