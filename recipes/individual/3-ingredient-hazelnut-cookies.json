  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 13–15 minutes. Wrap nuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 1 minute. Rub nuts in towel to remove loose skins (don't worry about skins that don't come off) and let cool completely. Pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped.",
    "Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or using a whisk), beat egg white and salt in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in sugar and chopped hazelnuts until well combined.",
    "Using a tablespoon, spoon batter onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing about 2\" apart. Bake cookies until golden brown, 16–18 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool."
