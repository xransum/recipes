Coarsely chop chiles; transfer to processor. Add butter, garlic, and lime peel; process until smooth. Season jalapeño-lime butter to taste with salt. Transfer to small bowl. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)",
    "Grill corn until husks are blackened on all sides, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes. Wearing oven mitts to protect hands, remove husks and silk from corn. Serve immediately with jalapeño-lime butter and salt."
