        "In a skillet cook the bell pepper in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the garlic, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. In a bowl stir together the bell pepper mixture, the ricotta, and 1/3 cup of the Parmesan with salt and pepper to taste and let the filling cool.",
        "Make 12 cr\u00eapes (procedure follows) with the herbed cr\u00eape batter. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling on each cr\u00eape up jelly-roll fashion. Arrange the cr\u00eapes, seam sides down, in a buttered shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer, brush them lightly with the butter, and sprinkle them with the remaining Parmesan. Bake the cr\u00eapes in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 20 minutes and serve them with the sauce.",
        "In a blender or food processor blend the flour, the broth, the eggs, the butter, and the salt for 5 seconds. Turn off the motor, with a rubber spatula scrape down the sides of the container, and blend the batter for 20 seconds more. Transfer the batter to a bowl, stir in the herbs, and let the batter stand, covered, for 1 hour. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Makes enough batter for about 16 cr\u00eapes.",
        "Heat a crepe pan or non-stick skillet measuring 6 to 7 inches across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with the butter, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and remove it from the heat. Stir the batter, half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it, and pour the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a layer of batter and return any excess batter to bowl. Return the pan to the heat, loosen the edge of the cr\u00eape with a spatula, and cook the cr\u00eape for 1 minute, or until the top appears almost dry. Turn the cr\u00eape, cook the other side lightly, and transfer the cr\u00eape to a plate. Make cr\u00eape with the remaining batter in the same manner, brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary. The cr\u00eapes may be made 3 days in advance, kept stacked, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled.",
        "To make the tomato sauce: Force the canned tomatoes with the juice through a food mill into a saucepan. Stir in the salt, the sugar, the tomato paste, the basil, and the cayenne, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it, stirring, for 20 minutes. Add the fresh tomatoes and cook the mixture for 5 minutes. Serve the sauce warm. Makes about 1 1/4 cups."
