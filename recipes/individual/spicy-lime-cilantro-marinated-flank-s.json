Marinate the flank steak with 1/2 cup of the puree in a resealable bag overnight in the refrigerator.  Reserve the rest of the puree to use later as a sauce.",

        "While grill is warming, remove the meat from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Discard any marinade left in the bag. Liberally season the steak with the kosher salt, and cook to desired doneness, approximately 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.",
        "To serve, slice the steak against the grain into 1/8 to 1/4 inch slices, and drizzle the remaining marinade over the meat."
