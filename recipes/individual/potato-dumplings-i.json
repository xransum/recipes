        "The day before, boil potatoes with the skins on until tender.  Cook enough to make at least 6 cups cold riced potatoes.  Peel the potatoes, and rice them.  Refrigerate them until needed.",
        "Brown 2 to 3 pieces of bread in butter or margarine for croutons.  Cut into small pieces, and let cool.",
        "Combine riced potatoes, 5 or 6 beaten eggs, salt, and flour.   Add croutons, and mix together.  The mixture should stick together.  Too much flour will make them heavy.",
        "Form into balls about the size of tennis balls.  Drop into boiling water in a large pot.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes.  Serve immediately."
