        "Wash spareribs. Remove excess fat and gristle. Place the whole rack in a shallow baking pan. Mix the rest of the ingredients together. Pour over the spareribs. Marinate one hour. Turn over and marinate another hour. Drain, reserving the marinade. Place spareribs in the shallow baking pan. Bake in moderate 350\u00b0F. oven 20 minutes on each side, brushing or basting with marinade every 10 minutes. Finish cooking by browning both sides of ribs under the broiler. If a high glaze is desired, brush lightly with honey before placing under broiler."
