        "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop the bacon into bite size pieces.",
        "Put the tomatoes, cucumber, and onion in a food processor or blender; process until the mixture has the texture of a viscous soup.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan; cook and stir the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour the tomato mixture into the pan. Season with parsley, salt, and pepper; cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the flavors blend to your liking, 40 to 60 minutes. Sprinkle the chopped bacon over the soup to serve."
