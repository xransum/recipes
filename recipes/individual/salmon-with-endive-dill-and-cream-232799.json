        "Preheat broiler. Line rack of a broiler pan with foil, then lightly oil foil. Pat salmon dry, then arrange, skin sides down, on broiler pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until almost cooked through, about 6 minutes. Keep warm, loosely covered with foil (fish will cook through from residual heat).",
        "Meanwhile, heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 shallots, stirring, 1 minute. Add endives and saut\u00e9, stirring, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add wine and boil over high heat, stirring, until liquid is reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 1 minute. Add cream and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and boil, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened and reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in dill, lemon juice, and salt to taste. Serve salmon with sauce."
