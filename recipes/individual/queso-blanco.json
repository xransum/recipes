        "Line a colander with a damp piece of muslin or cheesecloth. Place colander over a bowl or in the sink.",
        "Pour milk into a large saucepan; bring to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C), stirring frequently. Stir in salt.",
        "Pour vinegar into milk, a little at a time, stirring well after each addition until curds begin to separate from the whey.",
        "Spoon curds into the muslin-lined colander using a slotted spoon. Fold the muslin over the top of the curds. Fill a smaller container with water and place on top of the muslin to press down on the cheese. Let rest for 1 to 3 hours, allowing the liquid to drain from the cheese (the longer you allow the cheese to drain, the drier the cheese will be)."
