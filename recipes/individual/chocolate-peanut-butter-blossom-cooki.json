        "Beat the shortening and peanut butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Beat until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much of the flour and cocoa powder as you can with the mixer, using a wooden spoon at the end if necessary.",
        "Place the granulated sugar in a small bowl. Shape the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll the balls in sugar to coat. Place the balls 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.",
        "Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are firm. Immediately press a dark chocolate candy into the center of each cookie. Slide the parchment with the cookies on it to a wire rack; cool completely."
