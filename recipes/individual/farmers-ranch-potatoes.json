    "Place the potatoes in a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cut into chunks, leaving the skins on.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a large skillet until browned and crisp. Drain, and set aside.",
    "Place the potatoes in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, Ranch dressing, parsley, and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese. Crumble in the bacon and stir. Pour over the potatoes in the baking dish. In a another bowl, mix together the cornflake crumbs, melted butter and remaining cheese. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the casserole.",
