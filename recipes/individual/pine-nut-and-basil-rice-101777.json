        "In a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan cook pine nuts in oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon transfer pine nuts to a bowl. Add rice to oil in pan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and bring to a boil. Cover rice and cook over very low heat until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 18 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice stand, undisturbed, 5 minutes.",
