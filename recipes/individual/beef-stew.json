        "Heat oil in a large pot over high heat; saute beef until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add onion. Continue to saute until onion is softened and browned around the edges, about 5 minutes more. Transfer beef mixture to a bowl.",
        "Pour wine into the same pot used to cook beef and bring wine to a boil. Boil until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Stir beef bouillon into wine and cook until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Return beef to the pot and add milk, potatoes, carrots, and celery. Season with oregano, basil, coriander, pepper, cumin, and salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and continue to simmer until beef is tender, about 1 hour."
