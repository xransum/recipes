        "In a bowl whisk together yolks, whole egg, and granulated sugar and whisk in chocolate mixture. In pan heat remaining 1 1/4 cups cream and milk until mixture just comes to a boil. Add milk mixture to egg mixture in a stream, whisking, and whisk in Grand Marnier and zest. Skim off any froth.",
        "Divide custard among eight 1/2-cup flameproof ramekins set in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake custards in middle of oven until they are just set but still tremble slightly, about 40 minutes. Remove ramekins from pan and cool custards. Chill custards, covered loosely with plastic wrap, at least 4 hours or overnight.",
        "Set broiler rack so that custards will be 2 to 3 inches from heat and preheat broiler.",
        "Sift brown sugar evenly over custards and broil custards until sugar is melted and caramelized, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, raw sugar may be sprinkled over custards and caramelized with a blowtorch.) Chill custards 20 minutes."
