        "Roll each bread slice flat with a rolling pin and trim it to form a 2 1/2-inch square. Brush both sides of the squares lightly with the butter and fit the squares gently into 1/8-cup muffin tins (gem tins), pressing the bread against the sides of the tins. Bake the croustades in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the edges are pale golden. The croustades may be made 2 days in advance and kept in an airtight container.",
        "In a bowl stir together the artichoke hearts, the mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of the scallion, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste, divide the mixture by heaping teaspoons among the croustades, and sprinkle the remaining tablespoons Parmesan on top. Broil the croustades under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat, being careful not to let the croustades edges burn, for 1 minute, or until the filling is bubbling. Garnish the croustades with the scallion greens and arrange 3 of them on each of 6 heated small plates."
