        "In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Working in batches, add the beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Cook the vegetables",
        "Add the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil to the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrots and celery, cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Return the beef and any juices from the plate to the pan.",
        "Simmer the soup",
        "Add 1 1/2 quarts water to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour. Add the potatoes, the tomatoes and their juice and the green beans and stir well. Simmer until the beef and the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.",
        "Stir in the parsley and season the soup with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and serve immediately. If freezing, set aside to cool (see note above). Serves 6 to 8.",
