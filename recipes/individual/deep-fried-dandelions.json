        "Wash dandelions under cool running water and dry on paper towels. Remove the green tendrils behind each flower.",
        "Mix flour, curry powder, and salt together in a bowl or measuring cup. Beat egg in a bowl; stir in flour mixture until smooth. Add beer to mixture until batter is similar to runny pancake batter. Add more beer if batter is too thick.",
        "Heat oil in a small saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil until it begins to shimmer.",
        "Dip dandelion flowers in the batter and gently drop in the hot oil, working in batches. Fry flowers until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer cooked flowers to crumpled paper towels or on a wire rack; serve warm."
