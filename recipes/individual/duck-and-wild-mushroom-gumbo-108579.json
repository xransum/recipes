Add mushrooms, onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic to roux and cook until mushrooms and vegetables are soft, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes. Add stout; stir to blend. Add chicken broth, Emeril's Original Essence, bay leaves, thyme, cayenne, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt; stir to blend well. Return duck pieces to pot. Increase heat and bring to boil.
