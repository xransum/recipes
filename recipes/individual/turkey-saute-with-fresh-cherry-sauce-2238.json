  "directions": [
    "Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle turkey with salt and pepper. Add turkey to skillet and sauté until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer turkey to plate. Add shallots and thyme to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low heat and cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar and water and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Add cherries and fruit spread. Simmer until cherries soften and sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Return turkey and any collected juices to skillet. Simmer just until cooked through and hot, about 1 minute. Transfer turkey and sauce to plates."
