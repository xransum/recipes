Transfer lamb to a bowl with a slotted spoon and pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan.",
        "Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to pan and cook onions, carrots, kale, bay leaf, salt, and pepper over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add broth, water, and barley and simmer, covered, until vegetables and barley are tender, about 10 minutes. Add lamb and vinegar and gently simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes (for flavors to blend). Discard bay leaf."
