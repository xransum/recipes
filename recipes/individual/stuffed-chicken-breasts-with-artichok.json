        "Remove the chicken breast halves and shake off excess marinade. Discard the leftover marinade. Place the chicken between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.",
        "Mix together the artichoke hearts, olives, capers, and feta cheese in a bowl; spoon about 2 tablespoons of the feta mixture into the middle of each flattened chicken breast.
