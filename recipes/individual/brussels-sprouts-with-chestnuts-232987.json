        "Bring butter, salt, pepper, and 1 cup water to a boil over high heat in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet, then add Brussels sprouts and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add chestnuts, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes."
