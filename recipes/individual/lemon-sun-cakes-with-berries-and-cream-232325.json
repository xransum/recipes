Add milk and beat until just combined (mixture will appear curdled). Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture in 3 batches, beating until just combined after each addition.",

        "Arrange cakes upside down on 6 plates and top each with 2 rounded tablespoons whipped cream and 1 rounded tablespoon crushed berries. Scatter remaining whole berries over top and serve remaining crushed berries on the side."
