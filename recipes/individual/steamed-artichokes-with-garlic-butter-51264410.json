  "title": "Steamed Artichokes with Garlic Butter",
  "directions": [
    "Trim stems from 4 large artichokes (about 2 1/2 pounds), leaving about 1/2\" long. Snap off any browned leaves, then remove top fourth of artichokes; discard. If you like, use kitchen scissors to snip off any thorns.",
    "Bring 2\" of water to a simmer in a large pot. Fit with a steamer basket and place artichokes inside; season with salt and pepper. Cover and steam until leaves pull out easily and hearts are tender (a paring knife will meet with no resistance), 70–80 minutes. Remove from heat; squeeze 1 halved lemon over.",
    "Mix 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted unsalted butter and 1 finely grated garlic clove in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Serve with artichokes."
