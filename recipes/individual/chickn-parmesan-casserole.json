        "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).",
        "Bring the tomato sauce, basil, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and white pepper to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, and keep at a simmer. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. When the rotini is nearly ready, stir in the artificial chicken. Drain well.",
        "Spread half of the pasta sauce into the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish, then add the drained pasta mixture. Pour the remaining sauce on top of the pasta, then sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, about 20 minutes."
