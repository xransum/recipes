        "Place chicken on grill, breast side down. Close lid, and cook for 30 minutes.  Turn over, and cook for an additional 25 minutes, or until juices run clear and temperature is 185 degrees in the thickest part of the chicken. Keep the lid closed while cooking for even cooking, and to get more of that smoky flavor."
