        "Using your fingers, work thyme into granulated sugar in a small bowl until mixture starts to look moist and clump together. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat thyme sugar, butter, and powdered sugar in a large bowl until light and smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Use a rubber spatula to mix in any remaining dry spots or flour at the bottom of the bowl.",

        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Slice off both ends of log to make neat edges, then remove plastic and parchment. Slice dough into 1/4\"-thick rounds and place on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets, spacing about 1\" apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until edges of cookies are light golden but centers are still pale, 10\u201315 minutes.
