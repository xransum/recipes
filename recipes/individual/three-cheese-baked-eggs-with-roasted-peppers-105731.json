        "Roast peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. (Or broil peppers on a broiler pan about 5 inches from heat, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes.) Transfer to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, then let stand 20 minutes.",
        "When cool enough to handle, peel peppers, discarding stems and seeds, and cut into 1/3-inch dice.",
        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder into a small bowl.",
        "Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. Add butter, flour mixture, and cheeses and mix well at low speed, then stir in peppers and scallions.",
        "Pour into a buttered 10-inch (6-cup) glass pie plate and bake in middle of oven (or lower third of oven if baking with bacon) until top is golden brown and a tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving."
