        "Bring broth to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cover to keep warm. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; saut\u00e9 until tender, about 6 minutes. Add barley; stir until coated with butter, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup broth; simmer, stirring often, until broth is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Add remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently until barley is tender but still firm to bite and risotto is creamy, about 45 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until soft, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, herbs, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to risotto; stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide risotto among bowls and serve."
