While the vegetables are cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a small pot over medium heat. Add the flour to the melted butter and whisk for 1 minute, then whisk in the stock and season with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire. Cook for a few minutes, until thickened, then add to the turkey mixture. Stir in the peas into the turkey mixture and turn off the heat.",
