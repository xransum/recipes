        "In a small Dutch oven or enameled casserole over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and saut\u00e9 the turmeric, ginger, and lamb until the meat is well coated and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Finely dice one of the onions. Add it to the meat along with the broth, saffron, and cilantro. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the meat is fork tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Discard the cilantro.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. With a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to an ovenproof dish and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. Bring the sauce in the casserole back to a simmer.",
        "Finely slice the remaining onion. Add it, along with the prunes, honey, cinnamon, and pepper to the simmering sauce. Season with salt. Cook until the mixture thickens somewhat, 6 to 8 minutes. Spoon the prune sauce over the meat and sprinkle the dish with the sesame seeds. Serve with warm bread.",
        "<a name=\"note\">Note:</a> To toast and crush saffron, place threads in a small nonstick skillet and stir constantly over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Crush the threads between your fingers, or pound them in a mortar along with a pinch of salt before using."
