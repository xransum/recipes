  "directions": [
    "Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 500°F. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, 5–7 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels, reserving fat in skillet. Let cool, then break into 1/2\" pieces.",
    "Purée shallots and bell pepper in a food processor until finely chopped. Add shallot mixture to bacon fat; season with 1/4 tsp. salt. Cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated and mixture begins to look dry, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.",
    "Toss panko with oil and parsley in a small bowl; season lightly with salt. Spread a layer of salt on a rimmed baking sheet and arrange clams over to keep steady. Top each clam with a level 1/2 tsp. shallot mixture (you may have extra), then top with bacon and breadcrumb mixture. Roast until breadcrumbs are lightly toasted and clams are just cooked through, 6–8 minutes."
