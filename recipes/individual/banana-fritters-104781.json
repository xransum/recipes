        "Heat 3 inches of oil in a heavy saucepan or deep fryer to 375 degrees. Mix the eggs, milk, brown sugar, flour, and baking soda together in a medium-sized bowl. Add the banana slices a few at a time, coating them well with the batter.",
        "With a long slotted spoon remove the banana slices a few at a time and place them into the oil. Fry the bananas for 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly browned, turning them once. Drain them on paper towels and transfer them to a serving platter. Repeat the process until all of the bananas have been fried. Sprinkle them with the confectioners' sugar and serve warm."
