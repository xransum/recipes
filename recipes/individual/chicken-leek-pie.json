        "Preheat an oven to 375\u00baF.",
        "In a large ovenproof fry pan over medium-high heat, melt 4 Tbs. of the butter. Add the leeks, season with salt and pepper, and saut\u00e9 until softened, about 5 minutes. Add 1/3 cup of the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in the wine and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken and peas, and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Make the topping and bake the pie",
        "In a bowl, combine the remaining 2 cups flour, the baking powder and the 1/2 tsp. salt. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the remaining 5 Tbs. butter until the mixture forms coarse crumbs about the size of peas. Add the milk and, using a rubber spatula, stir until evenly moistened. Place heaping spoonfuls of the batter evenly over the chicken filling.",
        "Bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 minutes. Serves 4 to 6.",
