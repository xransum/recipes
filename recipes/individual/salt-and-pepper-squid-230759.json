    "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F.",
    "Heat 2 inches oil in a deep 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over high heat until it registers 390°F on thermometer.",
    "Dredge one third of squid in one third of cornstarch, shaking off excess, then fry, stirring occasionally, until crisp and just barely beginning to turn pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Coat and fry remaining squid in 2 batches in same manner, returning oil to 390°F between batches. Toss squid with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
