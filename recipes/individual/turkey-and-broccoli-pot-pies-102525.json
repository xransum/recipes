    "Preheat oven to 400°F. Unroll pastry sheet on work surface. Cut out two 3 1/2-inch squares (reserve remaining sheet for another use). Place squares on small baking sheet; pierce squares several times with fork. Bake until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, sprinkle turkey with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey and sauté until brown, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli and bell pepper. Sauté until broccoli is crisp but tender, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle turkey and broccoli with flour; stir 1 minute. Add broth; bring to boil, stirring up browned bits. Simmer until sauce thickens and turkey is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Divide turkey mixture between two 1 1/4- to 2-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Top each with pastry square."
