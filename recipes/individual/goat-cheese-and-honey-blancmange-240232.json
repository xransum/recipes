        "Pour milk into a medium pot and sprinkle agar on top. Allow to rest until agar (or gelatin) becomes clear and puffs slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Bring milk to a simmer; cook, stirring often, until flakes dissolve, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool slightly (leave just warm enough to melt\u2014not curdle\u2014cheese). Whisk in half-and-half, cheese, honey and vanilla seeds. Divide mixture among 8 martini glasses or 1-cup ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap; chill until set, about 2 hours. Mix strawberries, vinegar, basil, thyme, pepper and sugar in a bowl. If serving in glasses, top each with berry mixture. If serving out of a ramekin, run a knife along the inside edge and turn out onto a plate; top with berry mixture."
