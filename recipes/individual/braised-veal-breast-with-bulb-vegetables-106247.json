        "2. Add the next nine ingredients to the pan and cook, stirring, until the onion begins to brown. Add the cabbage; cook until wilted and browned slightly. Add 1 cup each of the wine and cider. Return veal to the pot. Season with salt, cover and braise in the oven until the meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.",

Reduce for 15 minutes to thicken. Adjust seasonings. Return veal to the pot; simmer, basting with sauce until it is syrupy and the meat is nicely glazed.",
