        "Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the egg into the butter until completely blended, then stir in the rhubarb.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the raisins, nuts, and flax seeds; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.",
