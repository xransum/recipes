        "In a cocktail shaker, combine the mint leaves with the Simple Syrup and lime juice. Using a muddler or the handle of a long wooden spoon, crush the mint. Add the rum and fill the cocktail shaker about two-thirds full with ice cubes. Cover and shake vigorously for 5-10 seconds. Strain through a strainer or fine-mesh sieve into a rocks glass filled with ice. Top with the sparkling wine. Garnish with the reserved mint leaf and a wedge of lime. Serve at once."
