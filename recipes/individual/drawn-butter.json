        "Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, 5 to 7 minutes. Set the melted butter aside to cool slightly, then skim the foam off the top and discard. Allow the butter to solidify overnight. Drain off any liquid that collects at the bottom. Melt the butter in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl, and pour into individual bowls before serving."
