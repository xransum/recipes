        "Warm a 3-qt (3-l) cast-iron kettle over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil, garlic, shallots, and salt and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, about 1 minute. Raise the heat to high, add the mussels, and toss to coat with the oil. Add the sugar, fish sauce, and 1 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium-high, cover, and cook until the mussels open, 3-5 minutes. Discard any that failed to open. The sauce should be the consistency of a light syrup. If the sauce is too thin, using a slotted spoon, transfer the mussels to a plate. Raise the heat to high and cook the sauce, stirring frequently, until reduced, 3-5 minutes. Return the mussels to the kettle and toss to coat.",
        "Garnish the mussels with the chile and cilantro sprigs and serve right away.",
        "For a more formal supper, set out a small seafood fork at each place setting. At a more casual meal, your guests can also use an empty mussel shell as a pair of pincers to pick the meats from the shells. Show diners this trick at the table. Set out a large bowl for the empty shells."
