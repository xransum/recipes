        "Whisk yolks, sugar and cup water in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk constantly until mixture thickens and candy thermometer registers 170\u00b0F., about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into egg mixture. Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is cool and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in peel.",

Press 1 square stack, buttered side down, into each cup. Repeat buttering, stacking and cutting with remaining 2 phyllo sheets. Press 1 square stack, buttered side down, atop first stack in each cup, positioning corners at different angles and extending over edges of cups. Brush phyllo with butter. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)",

Combine almond paste, yolk, 1 tablespoons butter, flour and vanilla in processor. Process until smooth.",
        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Divide almond filling among phyllo cups (layer will be thin). Place cups on baking sheet. Bake until filling is set and phyllo is golden, about 10 minutes. Cool 15 minutes.",
