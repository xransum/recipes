        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the anchovies with the oil in the skillet until the anchovies melt into the oil, about 2 minutes; add the onion and cook until translucent, 3 to five minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, wine, garlic, parsley, and seafood seasoning; lie the scallops into the liquid; season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the scallops are opaque, about 7 minutes. Serve over the cooked linguine."
