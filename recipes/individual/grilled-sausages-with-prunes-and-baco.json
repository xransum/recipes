        "Place toothpicks in a small bowl of water and soak 10 minutes to prevent burning on the grill.",
        "Slice sausages halfway through on the long side. Stuff 3 prunes into the opening. Wrap a bacon slice around the sausage in a spiral and secure with two toothpicks. Repeat with all 6 sausages.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.",
        "Place sausages onto preheated grill and cook, turning once, until desired doneness, or until bacon is browned. Serve on buns topped with desired condiments."
