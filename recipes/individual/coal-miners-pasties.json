Pour in the ice water, and form into a ball.  Add more water if it feels too dry.  Divide the dough into 6 balls, and wrap in plastic.  Chill one hour.",

        "Roll out one of the balls on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick.  Using a cake pan, trace a 9 inch circle in the dough; cut out the circle.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of the meat mixture into the middle of the circle.  Fold the edges of the circle up to meet along the top of the meat filling, and crimp the dough along the top to seal.  Repeat until all dough is used up.  With a spatula, transfer the pasties  to an ungreased sheet.",
