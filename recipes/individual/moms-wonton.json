        "In a large skillet, cook the ground pork over medium heat until no longer pink.",

        "Place about one teaspoon of the mixture in the center of each won ton wrapper. Bring points of the wrapper together (in a triangular shape) and pinch the edges, sealing them closed with egg whites.",
        "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil. Carefully place won tons into boiling water without crowding. (Work in batches if necessary.) When the wontons float to the surface, add a cup of cold water and allow the water to come to a boil again. Then remove from the boiling water."
