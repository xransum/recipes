Turn the vegetables over and rearrange them on the baking sheet; roast until the skins are blackened on all sides. Place the blackened peppers and eggplants into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Set aside and allow the vegetables to cool about 20 minutes. Once cool, remove the skins and discard.",
