        "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F.",
        "2. Combine the first 6 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir together until the wet and dry ingredients are thoroughly combined, then stir in the raisins.",
        "3. Cut two pieces of baking parchment to fit the bottoms of two loaf pans. Lightly oil the sides. Divide the batter between the two lightly oiled loaf pans. Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the tops of the loaves.",
        "4. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of a loaf tests clean. Take care not to overbake.",
        "5. Allow the cakes to cool completely. Use a knife to go around the sides of the loaves to loosen, if needed, and carefully remove the loaves from the pans by tipping them into your hand, then set on a platter. Cut each loaf into 12 slices to serve."
