        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter eight 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes. Coat with sugar; tap out excess. Puree raspberries with 3 tablespoons sugar in processor. Strain into heavy medium saucepan, pressing on solids. Add cornstarch; whisk to blend. Whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens to consistency of pudding, about 3 minutes. Transfer raspberry mixture to large bowl; cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead; cover and let stand at room temperature.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add remaining 2/3 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into raspberry mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites. Divide souffl\u00e9 mixture among prepared dishes. Bake until puffed and pale golden on top, about 15 minutes. Serve souffl\u00e9s, passing chocolate sauce and ice cream separately."
