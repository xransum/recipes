Pulse to combine well and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Once mushrooms are at room temperature, add them, along with pan juices, to the bowl along with rice and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes or up to 1 day. If the mixture seems too wet to form into a patty, stir in 1-2 tablespoons oats.",
