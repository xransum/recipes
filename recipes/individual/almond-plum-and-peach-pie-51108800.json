        "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. In a bowl, toss peaches and plums with granulated sugar, cornstarch, juice, cinnamon and salt; add to pie pan with crust; dot with butter. Roll out round of dough; cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Carefully weave strips over filling, forming a lattice. Trim overhanging dough to 1 inch; roll overhang back on itself, pinching at 1/2-inch intervals, to form a crimped edge. Sprinkle raw sugar over pie. Bake until fruit bubbles and crust is golden, 65 minutes. Let cool."
