        "Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Starting at the leafy top, cut parsley and kale perpendicular to the stems in 1/2- or 1/4-inch cuts until you reach the point where there's nothing left but stems. Discard stems. Chop the pile of greens on your board with a knife or cleaver until the pieces of parsley and kale are no larger than 1/4 inch. It should be pretty fine, but you don't want it to turn into a paste. Transfer parsley and kale to a large mixing bowl. Toss quinoa, grape tomatoes, cucumber, and shallot with the parsley and kale.",
