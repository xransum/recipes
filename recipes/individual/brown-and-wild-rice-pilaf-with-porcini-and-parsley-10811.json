        "To a small saucepan of boiling water add the wild rice, remove the pan from the heat, and let the rice soak for 30 minutes. In a small bowl combine the, porcini and the hot water and let the mushrooms soak for 30 minutes. Strain the mixture through a rinsed and squeezed paper towel set over a measuring cup, reserving 3/4 cup of the soaking liquid, wash the porcini under cold water to remove any grit, and chop them. In a large saucepan bring the cold water and the porcini soaking liquid to a boil, stir in the wild rice, drained well, the brown rice, and the salt,and simmer the mixture, covered for about 40 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. While the rice is cooking, in a large skillet cook the onion in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened and stir in the porcini. Add the rice to the skillet with the parsley and salt and pepper to taste and combine the mixture well."
