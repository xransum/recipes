        "Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Pour in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili sauce, and honey, stir to mix, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a bowl, and stir the tofu into the sauce. Set the tofu mixture aside.",
        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.",
        "While the pasta is boiling, heat the sesame oil in clean wok or large skillet; cook and stir the bean sprouts, carrots, green pepper, and green onions until the vegetables are bright in color and slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the tofu with sauce and linguine; stir to combine."
