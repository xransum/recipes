        "In a small bowl, combine the coriander, cumin, chile powder, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, caraway, black pepper and oil, pressing out any lumps of sugar. On a baking sheet, rub the mixture all over the pork and let sit, covered at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight. Return to room temperature.",
        "Light a grill and oil the grates. Grill the pork over moderately high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0, about 9 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let sit for 10 minutes, loosely tented with foil before cutting into thick slices. Serve with warm grilled naan, haloumi and yogurt."
