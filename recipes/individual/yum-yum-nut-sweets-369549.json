        "Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Grease a 7- or 8-inch square baking pan with the oil. Set aside. Place the nuts in a food processor and chop until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Put the contents into a small mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar and egg whites. With a spatula, scrape the contents of the bowl into the oiled pan and press into an even layer. Bake for 1 hour for soft cookies or 1 1/2 hours for crisp cookies. Remove from the oven. Allow to cool. Cut into 1 3/4- or 2-inch squares."
