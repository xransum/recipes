Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with sea salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.",

    "Sprinkle fish with sea salt and pepper; dust lightly with flour. Heat canola oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and sauté until brown and just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side.",
    "Whisk vinaigrette over low heat to warm slightly. Thinly slice each mushroom on slight diagonal; overlap slices in row on 1 side of each plate. Spoon vinaigrette onto opposite side of plate; top with fish."
