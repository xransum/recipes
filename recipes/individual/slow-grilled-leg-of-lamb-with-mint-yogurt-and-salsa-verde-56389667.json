        "Blend rosemary, garlic, and 3/4 cup oil in a blender or food processor until rosemary and garlic are finely chopped. Season lamb all over with salt and pepper and smear with rosemary mixture.",
        "Grill lamb, fat side up, over direct heat, turning often and moving to cooler side of grill as needed to control flareups, until evenly browned all over, 15\u201320 minutes (lamb and marinade are both very fatty, so monitor closely and move off the grill for a moment if flare-ups get too intense). Position lamb over indirect heat and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of lamb registers 135\u00b0, 1 1/2\u20132 hours. (The leg is composed of several muscle groups; take the temperature in multiple spots for the most accurate reading.)",
        "Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Holding bone, thinly slice lamb against the grain, continuing until you reach the bone. Rotate lamb and continue to thinly slice (slice only as much as you are serving.)",
        "Top lamb with lemons and mint; serve with mint yogurt and salsa verde.",
        "Lamb can be marinated 1 day ahead; chill. Lamb can be grilled 2 hours ahead; hold at room temperature. Grill over high to reheat, about 4 minutes, before slicing and finishing as directed above."
