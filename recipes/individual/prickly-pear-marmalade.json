    "directions": [
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add six 4-ounce jars; simmer to sterilize. Wash lids and rings in warm soapy water.",
        "Slice ends off each prickly pear. Make 1 long vertical slit down each one. Use the slit to hold the skin and peel off. Discard peel. Cut flesh into quarters and transfer to a saucepan; mash with a potato masher.",
        "Simmer prickly pear flesh over medium-low heat until soft, 30 to 45 minutes. Press cooked flesh through the fine screen on a food mill set over a bowl.",
        "Measure 1 1/4 cup prickly pear pulp into the saucepan. Add sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter; bring to a boil. Stir in pectin until dissolved, about 1 minute.",
        "Pour prickly pear mixture into hot jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the stockpot, and process for 5 minutes.",
        "Remove the jars from the pot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, and let cool, at least 24 hours."
