        "Prepare a medium-hot fire for direct-heat cooking in a grill. Place the ears of corn on the grill rack and grill, turning them as needed to color evenly, for 10 minutes, until they have a bit of char to them but haven't cooked so much that the kernels have wrinkled. You want to maintain the sweet, fresh corn crunch. Remove from the grill and cut in half crosswise.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the recado and lime juice. Add the corn and toss until evenly coated. Take a bite of one ear and adjust the remaining ears with more recado and lime juice to taste. Serve hot."
