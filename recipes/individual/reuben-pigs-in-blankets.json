        "Unroll the crescent dough and pinch the seams together with your fingers. Cut the dough in half lengthwise, then slice each half crosswise into 12 strips. Spread about 1 teaspoon of the sauerkraut-relish mixture on each strip of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border on one short end. Sprinkle with the cheese. Place 1 frank on each strip of dough and roll the dough around the frank, pressing lightly to seal.",
