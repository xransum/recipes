        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add salt. Drop beans in water and cook 3 minutes, then drain in colander. In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium-low heat, stirring until it renders most of its fat and is nearly crisp. Pour off all but 1 tbsp fat. Add garlic to skillet and cook over medium-low heat for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Raise heat, add beans and savory and toss 1 to 2 minutes to blend flavors. Season with pepper and salt, if needed."
