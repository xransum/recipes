In a large bowl toss potatoes, bell peppers, and 3 tablespoons oil with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange potatoes and bell peppers in one layer in 2 large shallow baking pans and roast in middle and lower thirds of oven (simultaneously, roast wrapped garlic on either rack), stirring occasionally and switching position of pans halfway through roasting time, until potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 35 minutes.",

With a fork mash garlic with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and tablespoon vinegar and toss together with potatoes and peppers and salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, add basil. Serve potato salad at room temperature."
