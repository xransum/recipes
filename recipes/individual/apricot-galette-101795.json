        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. In a food processor pulse almonds with confectioners' sugar until finely ground. Pit apricots and cut into 1/8-inch-thick wedges. On a lightly floured surface unfold pastry sheet and cut out a 9-inch round. Transfer round to a buttered large shallow baking pan and prick pastry all over with a fork. Spoon almond mixture evenly over pastry, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Decoratively arrange apricot wedges, overlapping them, on top of almond mixture and sprinkle with granulated sugar.",
