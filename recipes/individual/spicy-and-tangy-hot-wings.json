        "In a large bowl, mix together the red wine vinegar, malt vinegar, salad dressing, hot pepper sauce, 1 tablespoon chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, oregano and horseradish.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and 3 tablespoons of chili powder. Dredge the wings in the seasoned flour.",
        "Deep fry the wings for about 15 minutes, or until dark brown but not burnt. Drain briefly, then throw them into the bowl with the sauce. Stir to coat liberally. If you enjoy a hotter rather than tangy wing, liberally dash more hot pepper sauce onto the already sauce-coated wings."
