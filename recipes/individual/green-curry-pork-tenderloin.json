        "Combine soy sauce, orange juice, maple syrup, and sesame oil in a large resealable plastic bag. Add tenderloin; close bag, pressing out air. Chill, turning once, 4\u201312 hours. Remove tenderloin from marinade and pat dry; discard marinade. Season lightly with salt.",
        "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Heat grapeseed oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Cook tenderloin, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of tenderloin registers 130\u00b0F, 20\u201325 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing.",
        "While meat is cooking, heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook shallot and garlic, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add curry paste and lime zest and cook, stirring constantly, until paste is slightly darkened in color and very fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half, 20\u201325 minutes. Let curry mixture cool.",
        "Transfer curry mixture to a blender and add agave, lime juice, 1/4 cup cilantro, and 2 Tbsp. water; blend until very smooth. With motor running, add remaining 1/2 cup oil in a steady stream; blend until sauce is thick and emulsified. Transfer to a small saucepan and heat over medium just until warmed through.",
        "Serve pork over sauce topped with cilantro and pumpkin seeds.",
        "Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill."
