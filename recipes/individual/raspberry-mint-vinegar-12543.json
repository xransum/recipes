        "Put the mint leaves in a very clean 1-quart glass jar and bruise them with a wooden spoon. Add the raspberries and mash them with the spoon. Add the vinegar and let the mixture steep, covered with the lid, in a cool dark place for at least 4 days and up to 2 weeks, depending on the strength desired. Strain the vinegar through a fine sieve into a glass pitcher, discarding the solids, and pour it into 2 very clean 1/2-pint glass jars. Add the mint sprigs and seal the jars with the lids."
