Reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar melts into a syrup and starts to crystallize, about 1 hour. Continue stirring until syrup is mostly crystallized and ginger comes together in a pile in the center of the skillet and very little syrup drains out; remove from heat.",
        "Toss ginger slices gently to cool and separate from excess sugar. Spread slices out on a tray to cool and dry."
