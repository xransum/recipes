        "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the brownies start to pull away from the sides of the pan. Cool completely before frosting.",
        "To make the frosting, combine 2 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar and milk in a small saucepan over medium- high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cool and beat in the confectioners' sugar. Adjust the milk or confectioners' sugar if necessary to achieve a good spreading consistency. Spread over cooled bars and let set before cutting into squares."
