        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Finely chop garlic and rosemary with 1/2 teaspoon salt on a cutting board. Holding knife at an angle, drag blade over mixture until a coarse paste forms. Transfer paste to a small bowl and mix in oil.",
        "Place pork, fat side down, on another cutting board with a short end toward you. Holding a sharp knife parallel to board and about 1/2\" up side of loin, make an incision along entire length of one side. Continue cutting, lifting meat with your free hand as you go, until loin is open and flat. Spread garlic mixture over inside of loin and season with salt and pepper. Roll pork tightly; using kitchen twine, tie at 1\" intervals.",
        "Season pork with salt and pepper; place, fat side up, in a large shallow baking dish. Add wine; roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of loin registers 145\u00b0, 1 1/2-2 hours. Transfer to a carving board; let rest at least 10 minutes.",
        "Spoon fat from surface of pan juices; discard. Slice pork; serve with pan juices.",
