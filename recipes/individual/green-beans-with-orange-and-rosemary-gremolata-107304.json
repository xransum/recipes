        "Cook beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; rinse with cold water to cool quickly. Drain again. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in several layers of paper towels, then place in plastic bag. Chill.)",
        "Mix garlic, parsley, rosemary, orange peel, and lemon peel in small bowl. Transfer 1 tablespoon gremolata to another small bowl; reserve for garnish.",
        "Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining gremolata and stir 30 seconds. Add broth, orange juice concentrate, and lemon juice and bring to simmer. Add green beans. Cook until beans are heated through and liquid is reduced enough to coat beans thickly, tossing frequently, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer beans to bowl. Sprinkle with reserved gremolata."
