        "In a food processor fitted with the coarse grating disk grate the potatoes, peeled, and in a bowl toss them with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. In another bowl toss the carrots with the remaining 4 tablespoons cornstarch. In a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish spread half the carrot mixture, add the potato mixture, spreading it evenly, and sprinkle the shallot over the potatoes. Add the remaining carrot mixture, spreading it evenly, and tamp the mixture down with a rubber spatula. In a bowl whisk together the cream, the milk, the eggs, and salt and pepper to taste, pour the mixture over the carrot mixture, and bake the gratin in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and golden. Let the gratin cool and chill it, covered, overnight. Cut the gratin into diamonds, transfer the diamonds to a buttered baking sheet, and heat them in a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes, or until they are heated through."
