        "In a large skillet cook the onion and the bell pepper in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the pork, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until the pork is no longer pink. Stir in the tomato paste, the corn, the cumin, the allspice, the chili powder, the Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of the Tabasco, the cornmeal, and salt and black pepper to taste, simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, and add the additional Tabasco. Spoon the mixture into a shallow 2 1/2-quart casserole. The mixture may be made 1 day in advance and kept, covered and chilled.",
        "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the cornmeal, the sugar, and the baking powder, add the butter, the milk, and the egg, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Stir in the Monterey Jack and the chili peppers and drop the batter by the large spoonfuls around the edge of the casserole.",
