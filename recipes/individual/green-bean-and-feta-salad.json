        "Thinly slice the onion and place into a colander over the sink.  Add the cleaned green beans to a large pot of boiling water and boil until crisp tender (about 4 minutes).  When the beans are done, drain the water into the colander to slightly cook the onions.  Immediately rinse all in cold water to stop the cooking process.",

Add beans, onions and cheese and stir until combined.  Place in a nonreactive container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Enjoy!"
