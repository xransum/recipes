        "Pour milk into heavy medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Whisk sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl until no lumps remain. Add egg; whisk until well blended. Gradually whisk hot milk mixture into egg mixture. Return to same saucepan; whisk over medium heat until sauce thickens and boils, about 5 minutes. Pour into another medium bowl. Chill until cold, stirring occasionally, about 4 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled. Before serving, remove vanilla bean and whisk to loosen.)"
