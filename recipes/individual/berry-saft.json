        "Bring blackberry juice and sugar to a boil in a pot; cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Skim off any residue accumulated on top.",
        "Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack hot saft into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Store in refrigerator."
