        "To make the rhubarb syrup, place sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Lower heat to medium, and stir the rhubarb into the syrup. Simmer until rhubarb is softened and stringy, 5 to 7 minutes. Press out the juice with a spoon while straining syrup through cheesecloth or strainer into a glass jar or bottle. Discard rhubarb solids. Cool, and refrigerate syrup until needed.",
