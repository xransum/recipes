In a heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 shallots with bouquet garni, stirring, until shallots are golden. Add Port and deglaze pan, scraping up any brown bits. Add red wine and boil sauce until almost evaporated and reduced to a glaze, about 2 tablespoons. Add stock and boil sauce until slightly thickened and liquid is reduced to about 2/3 cup. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a small saucepan and discard bouquet garni. Season sauce with pepper and salt and keep warm, covered.",
