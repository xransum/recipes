        "In a shallow dish stir together the flour and the salt and in the flour mixture dredge the veal, 1 piece at a time, shaking off the excess. In a large non-stick skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saut\u00e9 the veal for 1 minute, or until it is pale golden. Turn the veal and saut\u00e9 it for 30 seconds more, or until it is pale golden and just springy to the touch. Transfer the veal to a platter and keep it warm, covered. Add to the skillet the wine, the lemon, and the capers and simmer the mixture for 1 minute. Swirl in the butter and the parsley and pour the sauce over the veal."
