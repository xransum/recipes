        "Bake meringue layers in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching positions halfway through baking, 1 hour, or until crisp and firm. (If weather is humid, cooking time may be longer.) Cool meringue layers completely on baking sheet in turned-off oven or on a rack and carefully peel off parchment. Meringue layers may be made 1 day ahead, wrapped well in plastic wrap or sealed in an airtight container, and stored in a cool, dry place.",
        "In a heavy saucepan stir together pur\u00e9e ingredients and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is softened, about 12 minutes. Cool mixture slightly and in a blender or food processor pur\u00e9e until smooth (use caution when blending hot mixtures). Transfer pur\u00e9e to a bowl and cool. Pur\u00e9e may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring pur\u00e9e to room temperature before proceeding.",

Repeat procedure with another meringue layer, 1/2 cup pur\u00e9e, remaining whipped cream, and 3/4 cup raspberries. Top with remaining meringue layer.",
