Boil the eggs for 1 minute and then remove the saucepan from the heat and let the eggs stand for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse the eggs under cold water until they are cool enough to handle. Peel and place the peeled eggs in a large bowl.",

With a large serrated knife, cut the sandwich diagonally in both directions to create 4 equal triangles. Repeat with the remaining bread and salad to make 16 tea sandwiches.",
