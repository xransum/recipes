Cover, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring the ratatouille once or twice to prevent scorching and to heat evenly, until the ratatouille is heated through and the fish fillets are opaque throughout, about 4 minutes more. Divide the halibut and ratatouille among 4 plates and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
