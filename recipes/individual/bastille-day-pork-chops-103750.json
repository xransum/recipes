        "1. Rub the pork chops on each side with the oil. Mince the rosemary and combine it with the oregano in a small dish. Press equal amounts of the herbs onto both sides of each pork chop and let them sit at room temperature for at least 2 hours, and in the refrigerator up to 8 hours.",
        "2. Build a small fire in a barbecue, and when the coals are red and dusted with ash, spread them out and set the grill about 3-inches above the coals. Grill the pork chops until they are golden on the outside and still moist and just slightly pink on the inside, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the grill, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
