        "Season veal with salt and pepper. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add veal and saut\u00e9 until cooked through and golden, about 1 minute per side. Using tongs, transfer veal to plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and shallots to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until shallots soften and brown, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Whisk in wine, sage and mustard. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Return veal and any collected juices to skillet. Simmer until just heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer veal to plates; spoon sauce over and serve."
