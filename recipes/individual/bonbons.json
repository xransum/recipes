    "directions": [
        "In large bowl, combine margarine, confectioners' sugar, condensed milk, coconut, chopped walnuts and vanilla.  Stir well.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or until mixture has thickened enough to roll into balls.  Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls and place close together, but not touching, on cookie sheets.  Freeze until hard.",
        "While bonbons are freezing, line a cookie sheet or flat surface with waxed paper.  Combine chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler, over, not in, simmering water.  Stir until melted.   Using a toothpick or a fork, dip each bonbon in the melted chocolate.  Place on waxed paper to dry.  When chocolate has hardened, store bonbons in plastic bag in the freezer."
