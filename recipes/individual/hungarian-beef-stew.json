        "Cook the onions and beef",
        "In a Dutch oven over high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the beef and onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until the beef is browned and the onions begin to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, paprika and tomato paste. Add the broth, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the meat is nearly fork-tender, about 1 hour.",
        "Finish the stew",
        "Add the potatoes, bell pepper and carrots, and continue to cook, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Divide the stew among individual shallow bowls and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.",
