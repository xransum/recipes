Bring vinegar, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Immediately pour brine over onion and let cool. Cover and chill at least 1 hour.",

Combine rice, coconut cream, and 1 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan, season lightly with salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 15\u201318 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (keep covered) 10 minutes; fluff coconut jasmine rice with a fork. Keep warm.",
