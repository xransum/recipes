        "In a large saucepan, stir together the half-and-half, the milk, the orange juice, the zest, and a pinch of salt and bring the mixture just to a boil over moderate heat. In a small heatproof bowl, whisk together the chopped chocolate and about 2/3 cup of the hot milk mixture until the mixture is smooth and whisk the chocolate mixture into the remaining milk mixture. Simmer the hot chocolate, whisking, for 2 minutes, discard the zest, and stir in the Grand Marnier. (For frothy hot chocolate, in a blender blend the hot chocolate in batches.) Divide the hot chocolate among heated mugs and garnish each drink with some of the whipped cream and grated chocolate"
