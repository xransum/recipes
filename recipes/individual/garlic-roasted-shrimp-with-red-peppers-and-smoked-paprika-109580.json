Divide mixture between prepared pans, arranging shrimp in single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Roast shrimp 10 minutes. Turn shrimp; sprinkle with oregano. Roast until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 7 minutes longer. Transfer shrimp and peppers to platter. Place pans over 2 burners on medium heat. Add half of Sherry to each; boil until reduced by half, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes. Drizzle over shrimp and serve warm or at room temperature.",
