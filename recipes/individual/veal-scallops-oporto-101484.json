  "directions": [
    "Flour scallops lightly and sauté in butter and olive oil, turning to brown evenly. When brown and tender, add port and cook gently for 2 minutes. Season to taste. Remove meat to a hot platter and add cream to pan. Stir to scrape up brown bits and thicken lightly with a little beurre manié. Taste for seasoning and pour over scallops. Serve with home-made noodles dressed with buttered crumbs. With this, drink a white Burgundy."
