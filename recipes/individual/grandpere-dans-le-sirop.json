        "In a large saucepan, mix together the brown sugar and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Cover while preparing the batter.",
        "In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, white sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in 1/3 cup of butter by pinching between your fingers, or using a fork until the mixture has lumps no larger than crumbs. Make a well in the center, and pour in the milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla all at once. Stir just until all of the dry mixture is absorbed.",
        "Return the sugar mixture to a full boil, and drop large spoonfuls of the batter into the syrup. Cover and simmer over medium heat, without removing the lid, for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the largest dumpling comes out clean."
