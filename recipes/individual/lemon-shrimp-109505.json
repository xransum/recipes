        "Peel and clean shrimp, leaving tails on. Partially fill a pot with water, add salt, and bring to a boil. Add shrimp and boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until shrimp pinks and the flesh looks opaque. Remove immediately. Drain and place hot shrimp into marinade. If additional liquid is needed to cover most of the shrimp, add a few tablespoons of the shrimp poaching water to the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours, turning the shrimp once.",
