        "In a heavy bottomed saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, salt and 1 cup non-dairy creamer.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.",
        "Combine vanilla and remaining creamer and stir, a little at a time, into caramel.  For a soft caramel, remove from heat and pour into a buttered 8x8 inch dish.  For a hard candy or caramel apple coating, continue cooking until mixture reaches hard ball stage, 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball."
