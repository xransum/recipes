        "Slice cucumbers in half lengthwise. If using Japanese cucumbers, scrape out seeds with a small spoon. Slice cucumbers into very thin half moons. Toss in a small bowl with a few pinches of salt. Let sit until salt begins to draw out water from cucumbers, about 5 minutes. Massage cucumbers to release liquid, gently at first to keep them from breaking, then more vigorously as they start to expel water. Rinse in several changes of water, squeeze out excess liquid, and place in a clean small bowl.",
        "Mash garlic and a pinch of salt on a cutting board with the side of a chef's knife to a paste. Mix into cucumbers along with both yogurts; season with salt.",
        "Mix flour, potato starch, and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl. Set slurry aside.",
        "Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high. Season beef with salt and pepper. Working in 2 batches, cook beef, turning occasionally and reducing heat if needed, until browned on all sides, 6\u20138 minutes per batch. Add onions and apple and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, 12\u201315 minutes. Add mirin, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, kuro sato, garam masala, soy sauce, and broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until beef is almost tender, 30\u201340 minutes.",
        "Add squash, potato, and carrots, cover, and cook, adding water by 1/4-cupfuls if needed to keep vegetables submerged, until tender, 20\u201330 minutes.",
        "Submerge a small sieve into curry and whisk reserved slurry into liquid in sieve to combine. Return curry to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until thickened, 8\u201310 minutes. Serve over rice topped with raita."
