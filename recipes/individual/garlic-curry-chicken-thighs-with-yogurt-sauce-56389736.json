Working in batches, add chicken thighs and turn to coat, using your hands to rub marinade under skin of each thigh. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and chill at least 3 hours or up to overnight.",
        "Position a rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 425\u00b0F. Transfer marinated chicken, skin side up, to a 13x9\" baking dish. Roast chicken until skin is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken registers 165\u00b0F, about 35 minutes. If chicken skin starts to burn, move pan to a lower rack to finish cooking.",
        "Transfer chicken to a serving platter, reserving pan juices. Whisk lemon juice, 1/4 cup pan juices, remaining 1 cup yogurt, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. If sauce is too thick, add more pan juices. Serve sauce alongside chicken.",
