        "Make the shrimp: Combine 8 cups water, the bay leaves, quartered lemon, peppercorns, coriander seeds and 2 tablespoons salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and add the shrimp. Simmer until the shrimp curl slightly and are just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove the shrimp to a plate with a slotted spoon; refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Serve with the cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.",
