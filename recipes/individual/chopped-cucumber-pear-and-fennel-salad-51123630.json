        "Cut 2 pounds cucumbers (we like English hothouse so we can skip peeling) into 3/4\" cubes. Place in a resealable plastic bag. Place fronds from 1 large fennel bulb cut into 1/2\" squares in a resealable plastic bag. Place fennel in a large bowl of water with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent browning; cover. Chill cucumber, fennel, and fronds overnight. Combine cucumber, drained fennel, 2 pears, peeled, quartered, cored, cut into 1/2\" pieces (about 2 cups), and 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds in a large bowl. Add 3/4 cup Granny Smith Apple Cider Vinaigrette; toss to coat. Add more vinaigrette, if desired. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with 1/4 cup pomegranate seeds and reserved fronds."
