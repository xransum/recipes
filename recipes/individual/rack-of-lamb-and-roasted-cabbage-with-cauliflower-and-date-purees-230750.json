        "Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chops on all sides, about 6 minutes total. (Adjust heat so oil sizzles but does not spatter.)",
        "Add butter and thyme and continue to cook, turning chops frequently with tongs and basting occasionally with cooking fat, until thermometer inserted between ribs to center of a chop (do not touch bone) registers 130\u00b0F for medium-rare, 16 to 20 minutes more. Transfer chops to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes, then cut each double chop into 2 chops.",
        "Mound cabbage in center of each of 4 plates and top each serving with 4 chops. Spoon cauliflower and date pur\u00e9es alongside cabbage and serve immediately."
