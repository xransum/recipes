        "Peel the shallot and cut into very thin slices. Put in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and the vinegar. Let the shallot soak in the vinegar for 15 to 20 minutes, then stir in the olive oil and mix well. Taste to see if the balance of vinegar and oil is right \u2014 you might need to add more of one or the other.",
        "To prepare the lettuces: Remove any damaged leaves on the outside. Separate the heads into individual leaves. Tear large leaves into smaller pieces. Wash them and gently in a bowl in plenty of cold water. Lift the lettuces out and drain.",
        "Spin dry in a salad spinner or lettuce drier. Only fill it half full at a time. The most important thing is to have dry lettuce or the dressing won't coat the leaves. As they are dried spread them out on a towel. Roll the towel up loosely, put in an airtight bag, and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
        "Toss the salad in the vinaigrette dressing just before serving."
