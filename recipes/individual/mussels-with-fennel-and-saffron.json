        "In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots and sliced fennel bulb and saut\u00e9 until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and chicken stock to the pot and crumble in the saffron threads. Season to taste with pepper. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the broth is aromatic, 4 to 5 minutes.",

        "Chop the fennel fronds to yield about 3 Tbs. To serve, ladle the mussels and broth into warmed bowls and sprinkle with the chopped fennel fronds. Serve immediately with the baguette slices for dipping in the broth. Serves 2 to 4.",
