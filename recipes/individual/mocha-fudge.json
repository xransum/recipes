        "In a medium saucepan, stir together the instant coffee, white sugar and salt. Stir in the milk and corn syrup, and add the butter. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Let cool to room temperature, or about 110 degrees F (45 degrees C).",
        "When the mixture is cool, beat with a wooden spoon until it loses its gloss. Add nuts and chocolate chips and stir slightly to create a marbled effect. Pour into a buttered 8 inch square baking dish. Arrange pecan halves on the top if desired. Cool completely before cutting into pieces."
