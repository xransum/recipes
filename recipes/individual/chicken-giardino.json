        "To Make Giardino Sauce: Heat butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add garlic, thyme, wine, pepper flakes and lemon juice. Saute for a few minutes over medium heat, making sure that you cook to reduce the acidity of the lemon juice (otherwise, when you add the cream, it will curdle). Stir in the water, then combine the sauce mix with a little cream and stir together until mixture is not lumpy; add mixture to skillet, then add the remaining cream and stir all together until slightly thickened. Set aside.",
