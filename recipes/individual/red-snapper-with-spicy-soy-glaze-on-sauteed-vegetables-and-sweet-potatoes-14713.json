        "Separately cut carrots and bell pepper into thin strips and diagonally cut snow peas into 1/2-inch pieces. Chop coriander. Peel sweet potato and, if desired, with a channel knife cut 4 lengthwise grooves (one every quarter turn). Cut potato crosswise into 12 slices (about 1/4 inch thick) and in a steamer set over 1 inch boiling water steam slices, in one layer if possible, covered, until just cooked through and tender but not falling apart, about 8 minutes.",
        "Remove steamer from heat and season potato with salt and pepper. Keep potato warm in steamer, covered. In a small saucepan heat glaze and keep warm, covered.",
        "Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F.",
        "In a non-stick skillet heat 1/2 teaspoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 2 fillets, skin sides down, pressing on fish with a metal spatula to help skin brown evenly, until skin is golden brown, about 1 minute. With spatula turn fillets over and saut\u00e9 until golden, about 30 seconds more. Transfer fillets, skin sides up, to a non-stick baking pan and saut\u00e9 remaining 2 fillets in 1/2 teaspoon oil in same manner. Bake fish in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 3 minutes.",
        "While fish is baking, in a large non-stick skillet heat 1/2 teaspoon remaining oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 carrots until barely tender, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil, bell pepper, and snow peas and saut\u00e9 vegetables, stirring, until just tender, about 30 seconds. Add cabbage and onion and saut\u00e9, stirring, until just tender, about 1 minute. Immediately transfer saut\u00e9ed vegetables to a bowl and toss with coriander, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Divide potato among 4 plates and top with saut\u00e9ed vegetables. Put fillets, skin sides up, on vegetables and drizzle with some glaze.",
        "Garnish plates with lime wedges and serve remaining glaze on the side."
