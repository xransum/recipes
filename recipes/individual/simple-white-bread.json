        "In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  Add remaining water, dry milk, oil, sugar, salt, and 3 cups of flour; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 3 minutes, or until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.",
        "Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease surface.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
        "Punch the dough down, and divide in half.  Shape into loaves.  Place in two greased 9 X 5 x 3 inch loaf pans.   Grease the tops of the loaves, and cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.",
        "Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove bread from pans to cool on wire racks.  Brush with melted butter or margarine."
