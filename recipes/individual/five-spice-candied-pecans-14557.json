        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Lightly oil a shallow baking pan and a 12-inch square of foil, keeping pan and foil separate.",
        "In a small heavy saucepan bring water to a boil with sugar, five-spice powder, and salt. Stir in pecans and simmer mixture, stirring, 1 minute. Immediately pour mixture evenly into pan and with a metal spatula spread pecans in one layer. Bake mixture in middle of oven 8 minutes, or until pecans turn mahogany-colored and most of liquid is evaporated. Immediately transfer pecans with metal spatula to foil, keeping them in one layer, and cool completely. (Pecans will continue to crisp as they cool.) Break up any pecans that have stuck together. (Candied pecans keep, in layers separated by wax paper, in an airtight container, frozen, 2 weeks.)"
