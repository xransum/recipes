        "Cut top 1/4 inch off each head garlic and wrap heads together in foil. Roast garlic 40 to 45 minutes, or until very soft, and let cool. Squeeze roasted garlic from each head (there should be about 1/3 cup) and in a blender or food processor blend together with mustard, vinegars, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. With motor running add oil in a very thin stream and blend until emulsified. Vinaigrette may be made 4 days ahead and chilled in a tightly sealed jar. Shake vinaigrette well or reblend before serving.",
