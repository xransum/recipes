        "Lightly coat an 8\" square baking dish with cooking spray. In a small saucepan, cook sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, until sugar melts and turns lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and add nuts, stirring quickly to combine. Immediately pour brittle into baking dish; spread evenly into a 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick layer and sprinkle with salt. Use a sharp knife to score the brittle into 8 wedges. Let cool completely. Remove brittle from pan and break into wedges. Chop wedges into small pieces. Divide yogurt, honey, apricots and brittle among 8 bowls."
