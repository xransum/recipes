        "Meanwhile, toss apples with 3 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until coated. Cook in a dry 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, swirling skillet and turning slices over occasionally, until tender and pale golden, about 15 minutes.",
        "Combine bread and apples in a 2-quart souffl\u00e9 or 2-inch-deep baking dish (about 8- by 12-inch oval).",

        "Bake in a water bath until edge is set but center still trembles slightly when dish is gently shaken, 50 minutes to 1 hour for souffl\u00e9 dish or 35 to 40 minutes for shallow dish. Cool pudding to warm in baking dish on a rack, about 1 hour. (Pudding will continue to set as it cools.)"
