        "In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar and plenty of pepper. Set aside.",
        "Stack half the lettuce leaves, roll them up and cut crosswise into thin slices. Repeat with the remaining lettuce leaves.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the lettuce and other greens, scallions, dill, mint, borage (if using) and fennel. Whisk the dressing again and pour it over the salad. Add salt to taste, toss, and sprinkle with the pine nuts, if using. Serve at once.",
        "NOTE: There is no substitute for borage \u2014 its sweet taste and crunchy texture are unique \u2014 but I have heard it compared to very tender cucumbers. If you like, add 1/2 cup coarsely grated cucumber to the salad."
