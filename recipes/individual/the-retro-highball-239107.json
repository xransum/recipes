        "A matter of preference, naturally. A ratio of 2 ounces spirit to 2 ounces soda is a good place to start if you truly want to savor the base spirit in all its glory. If it's too much, add soda 1 ounce at a time until it suits your taste. Measure along the way and make a note of your preference so that you'll always know just how much to pour."
