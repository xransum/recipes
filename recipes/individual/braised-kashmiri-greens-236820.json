        "Discard the tough stems from the greens. Chop the tender stems and set aside, then roughly chop the leaves.",
        "Heat the oil in a large, wide pot over moderately high heat until it shimmers, and add the asafetida and cumin seeds. Cook, stirring, until the spices are fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the shallots, ginger, and chile, and cook, stirring, until the shallots are translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stems of the greens and salt to taste, then cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the greens and cook, tossing occasionally with tongs, until just tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the chile and season with salt and pepper to taste."

    "ingredients": [
        "5 pounds braising greens (see note above)",
        "1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil or olive oil",
        "1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon asafetida*",
        "3 teaspoons cumin seeds",
        "3 large shallots, sliced",
        "3/4 cup julienne strips peeled ginger",
        "1 1/2 small dried red chiles, broken in half (see note)",
        "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
        "*Asafetida, a spice made from the resin of the giant fennel (Ferula), has a strong, disagreeable smell from sulfur compounds, so a little goes a long way. Its flavor after cooking is like the mildest, mellowest garlic you've ever tasted. Asafetida is sold in lump and ground form and is available at Indian and Middle Eastern markets or kalustyans.com. If unavailable, garlic powder makes a good substitute."
