        "Stir in another pinch of baking soda; the sauce will foam.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and almost brown.  Make sure to scrape the sides of the pan in to the sauce.",
        "After the sauce is fork consistency, stir in Parmesan cheese.  Watch that the cheese does not burn.  Taste sauce.  If it is too tangy or acidic, add another pinch of baking soda and simmer another 1/2 hour.",
        "Cool, cover, and refrigerate overnight.  The next day, reheat and serve."
