        "Divide the pie dough in half, shape each into a disk and wrap separately with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.",
        "In a small bowl, combine the cheese, tomato sauce and desired toppings. Set the filling aside.",
        "Preheat a Breville electric pie maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Let the dough stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a round about 1/8 inch thick. Using the larger side of the circle cutter, cut out 4 rounds, rolling out the remaining dough disk and rerolling the scraps as needed. Transfer the dough rounds to the parchment-lined baking sheet. If they become too warm or soft, refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Open the pie maker and assemble the pizzas according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using the dough rounds for the base of each pizza and 1/3 cup filling per pizza. Close the lid on the pie maker, ensuring the latch clicks into place, and bake until the dough is cooked through and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Using a mini-pie lifter, a nonstick heatproof spatula or tongs, carefully transfer the pizzas to a wire rack and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes, before serving. Makes 4 individual pizzas.",
