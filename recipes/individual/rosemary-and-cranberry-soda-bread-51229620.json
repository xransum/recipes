        "Sift the flour, bread soda and salt into a bowl. Stir the cranberries and rosemary through and make a well in the centre. Add the buttermilk and using a large spoon, mix gently and quickly until you have achieved a nice soft dough. Add a little bit more buttermilk if necessary, until the dough binds together without being sloppy.",
        "Knead the dough very lightly on a lightly floured surface and then shape into a round that is roughly 15cm (6in) in size. Place on a non-stick baking sheet and cut a deep cross in the top.",
        "Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F/gas mark 6) and bake for another 20\u201325 minutes, until the loaf is evenly golden and crusty. To check that the bread is properly cooked, tap the base \u2013 it should sound hollow. If it doesn't, return it to the oven for another 5 minutes.",
        "Transfer the cooked soda bread to a wire rack and leave to cool for about 20 minutes. This bread is best eaten while it's still warm.",
        "To serve, place the soda bread on a breadboard and cut into slices at the table. Have a dish of butter to hand for spreading."
