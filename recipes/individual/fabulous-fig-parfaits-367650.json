        "To make the nut kreme, place the soaked nuts and half of the dates in a blender and blend slowly, adding up to 1/4 cup of the reserved soaking liquid, until the mixture is smooth yet thick.",
        "To make the raspberry sauce, blend the remaining half of the dates, the raspberries, and the remaining 1/4 cup of the reserved (soaking) liquid until smooth. The sauce should have a thin consistency; if needed, add additional filtered water.",
        "To prepare the parfaits, starting from the top, cut the figs lengthwise into quarters (leaving the bottoms intact) and gently press open. Spoon some of the nut kreme into the middle of each fig. Arrange the parfaits on a platter and drizzle raspberry sauce over the top of each parfait. Garnish with the fresh mint leaves or shredded coconut."
