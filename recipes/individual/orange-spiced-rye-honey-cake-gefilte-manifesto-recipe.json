  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Generously grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with oil.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 1/2 cups of oil, the eggs, sugar, honey, coffee, and orange zest. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.",
    "Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the egg mixture, then stir with a fork or a whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until set in the middle—the cake should hold firm when lightly pressed on top. Be careful not to leave it in the oven for too long or it will dry out.",
    "Let the cake cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes—1 hour for a Bundt cake (see note)—before very carefully inverting it and removing the pan. Slice and serve with fresh fruit and tea."
