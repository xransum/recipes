        "Remove the skin from the salmon (and bones if you prefer). Combine salmon, optional carrots, onions, eggs, cooled rice, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well with your hands. Form into 8 (tennis ball sized) balls, using about 3/4 cup salmon mixture per portion. Arrange balls in the prepared pan, allowing room for them to expand. Mix the soup and 1/2 cup water together in a small bowl; pour over the salmon balls.  Cover with foil.",
