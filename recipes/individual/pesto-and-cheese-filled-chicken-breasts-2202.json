Spread boned side of chicken breast with scant 2 tablespoons cheese mixture. Starting at one long side of chicken breast, roll up tightly, jelly roll style. Repeat with remaining chicken and cheese mixture.",

Place skillet with chicken in oven and bake until chicken is tender and cooked through, about 10 minutes."
