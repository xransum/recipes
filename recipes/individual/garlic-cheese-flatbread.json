        "In a cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast over the surface of the lukewarm water. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to dissolve.",
        "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and sugar. Pour in the yeast mixture along with the olive oil. Beat with a sturdy spoon until  dough is stiff enough to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Cover, and set aside until doubled in size, about 35 minutes.",
        "Remove the dough from the bowl and knead briefly on a floured surface. Roll the dough out to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness or to the size of your baking sheet. Place on a greased baking sheet and spread butter over the top. Sprinkle with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese. Let rest while you preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown and cheese is bubbly. Serve warm."
