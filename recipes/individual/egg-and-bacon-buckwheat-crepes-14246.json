        "Cut bacon into strips about 1/8 inch wide and 1 inch long. In a skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until golden and crisp and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.",
        "Preheat broiler.",
        "Brush a 10-inch non-stick skillet lightly with oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Remove skillet from heat. Working quickly, stir batter and fill a 1/4-cup measure. Pour batter into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom. Cook cr\u00eape over moderately high heat until bottom is golden and top appears almost dry, about 1 minute. Turn cr\u00eape over and break 1 egg onto center. Sprinkle one-fourth Gruy\u00e8re and one-fourth bacon over egg and season with salt and pepper. Fold in edge of cr\u00eape to form a square, leaving egg exposed, and cook about 30 seconds. Slide cr\u00eape from skillet onto a large baking sheet.",
        "Make 3 more cr\u00eapes with remaining batter, eggs, cheese, and bacon in same manner, brushing skillet lightly with oil before cooking each cr\u00eape. Broil cr\u00eapes 4 to 5 inches from heat until egg whites are set, about 30 seconds."
