        "Mix Parmesan cheese, butter, creamy salad dressing, and paprika together in a bowl.",
        "Shape 2 sheets of aluminum foil into boats just wide enough to hold lobster tails upright; sides should be 1 inch high. Set lobster tails belly-side up in boats. Squeeze more lemon juice over lobster meat. Spoon Parmesan cheese mixture evenly on top.",
        "Set lobster tails inside the prepared baking dish. Pour in 1/2 inch water around the boats. Place juiced lemon wedges in the water.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until lobster meat flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Turn oven to broil; broil until tops are crispy, about 2 minutes. Crack oven door open; broil for 1 to 2 minutes more."
