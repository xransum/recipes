        "Place the cranberries, sugar, and water in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and cook until all the cranberries have popped, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the apple, celery, orange zest, orange juice, pecans, raisins, ginger, cloves, and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the celery is tender and the sauce is reduced, about 35 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the saucepan, and let the chutney stand to thicken, about 15 minutes. Serve warm."
