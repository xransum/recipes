Place chicken halves in baking dish or roasting pan with skin sides up, leaving space around chicken so halves aren't touching.",
        "Roast in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted in a thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing."
