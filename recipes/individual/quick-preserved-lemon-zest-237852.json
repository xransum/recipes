        "Remove the zest from the lemons with a vegetable peeler (be careful not to take off too much of the white pith) and place in a small bowl. Toss with the salt, sugar, bay leaves, chili, and the juice of one of the lemons. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Remove the zest from the mixture, rinse, pat dry, and cover with extra-virgin olive oil to store in the refrigerator for up to a month."
