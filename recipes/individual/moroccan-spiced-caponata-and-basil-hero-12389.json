Stir in eggplant, bell peppers, onion, garlic, water, lemon juice, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes, or until eggplant is almost tender. Stir in zucchini and simmer uncovered, until vegetables are tender and most liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Cool caponata slightly and transfer to a bowl.
