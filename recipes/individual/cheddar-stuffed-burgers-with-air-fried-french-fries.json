Continue cooking until the potatoes are cooked through and golden brown on the outside, about 15 minutes more, opening the basket 2 or 3 times during cooking to toss and stir them.",
        "While the fries are cooking, make the burgers. Divide the ground beef into eight 3-oz. (90-g) portions and shape each into a ball. Using a stuffed hamburger press according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, make 4 burgers, stuffing each with a quarter of the cheese. Season the burgers with salt and pepper.",
        "Grill the burgers, turning once, until medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your preferred doneness. Grill the buns, cut side down, until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread the cut sides of the buns with the burger sauce, then place the burgers on the buns along with the lettuce and onion.",
        "Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, sprinkle with French fry seasoning and toss to coat evenly. Serve the burgers with the fries alongside. Serves 2.",
