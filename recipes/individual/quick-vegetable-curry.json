        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until the onions are transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Combine the tomatoes, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, and water with the onions. Stir in the turmeric, chili powder, cumin, coriander, and mustard seed until blended. Season with salt to taste. Add the potatoes, carrots, peas, and corn. Turn the heat to high, and cook the vegetables 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat to medium, and cook another 7 minutes.",
