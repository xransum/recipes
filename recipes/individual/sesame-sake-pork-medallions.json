Cook pork, seed side down, over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. While cooking, press remaining sesame seeds onto tops of medallions. Turn over and continue to cook 4-6 minutes. Increase heat to high, add sauce and cook 2 minutes or until sauce bubbles and thickens slightly. Serve pork medallions drizzled with sake sauce. Sprinkle with any remaining sesame seeds and green onion."
