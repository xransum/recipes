        "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Lightly coat a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2\" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Pulse cocoa powder and 1 cup almonds in a food processor until very finely ground, about 1 minute.",
        "Microwave chocolate and 1/4 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals (or heat in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water), stirring occasionally, until melted. Whisk in oil and salt, then almond mixture and half of granulated sugar, then egg yolks.",
