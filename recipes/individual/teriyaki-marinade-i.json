        "In a large saucepan, combine ginger, garlic, and 1 cup vermouth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until ginger and garlic are tender.",
        "Stir in remaining vermouth, soy sauce, honey, and oyster sauce. Bring to a low boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes to 1 hour; longer is better, but 15 minutes will do in a pinch. Watch carefully to be sure that the mixture does not foam and boil over.",
        "Remove marinade from heat, and taste. The sauce should be sweet, not salty. If necessary, add up to 1 more cup of honey. Cool to room temperature. Marinade can be refrigerated for 4 to 5 days."
