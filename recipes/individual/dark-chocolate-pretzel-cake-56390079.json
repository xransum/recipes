Place the butter and chocolate in a large bowl over a pot of simmering water and stir until melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and set aside. Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and whisk until the mixture is thick and glossy.",

Pour into the pan and arrange the pretzels on top. Bake for 25 minutes or until the edges are cooked when tested with a skewer and the center is just set. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until chilled.
