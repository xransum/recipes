    "Preheat oven to 325ºF. Spread pecans on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast, tossing once, until fragrant and lightly golden, 8–10 minutes. Let cool completely.",
    "Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add coriander, cumin, and fennel seeds and toast, stirring frequently, until sesame seeds are golden and spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and let cool completely.",
    "Coarsely chop 1/4 cup pecans; set aside. Pulse sesame seed mixture, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 cup pecans in a food processor until coarse, dry, and crumbly; do not let it become a paste.",

    "Meanwhile, coarsely chop fennel fronds; set aside. Cut fennel bulb in half lengthwise, then thinly slice each half lengthwise.",
    "Whisk lemon zest, oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper in a large bowl. Add green beans, fennel bulb, and half of the dukkah and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer salad to a serving platter, then top with fennel fronds, remaining dukkah, and remaining 1/4 cup pecans.",
