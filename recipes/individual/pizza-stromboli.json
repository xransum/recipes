        "Spread 1/2 of cheese down the center third of the dough. Top with 1 cup Spicy Pizza Sauce and 1 cup of chopped vegetables. Top with remaining cheese.",
        "Cut 1-inch crosswise strips down the sides of the rectangle. Starting from one end, bring one of the dough strips across the filling diagonally.

Sprinkle with dehydrated onions or poppy seed.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown."
