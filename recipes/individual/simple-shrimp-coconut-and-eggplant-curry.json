        "Heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan and fry the onion, garlic, ginger and chili for 2 to 3 minutes to soften, stirring frequently. Stir in the spices and season well with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to fry over medium heat for a further minute or two until fragrant. Transfer the mixture to a mini food processor and blend until smooth, adding a splash of water if necessary to loosen the consistency to a paste.",
        "Return the pan to the heat and put in another tablespoon of coconut oil. Add the paste and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggplant and saut\u00e9 for a minute or two, stirring to coat it with the paste, before adding the cherry tomatoes. Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes.",
        "Add the coconut milk and the shrimp and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through and the sauce has just thickened. Stir in the spinach, wilt for a minute, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately."
