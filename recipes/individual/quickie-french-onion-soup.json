        "Turn on oven broiler and divide soup evenly among 4 oven safe soup crocks.  Place several croutons on the top of the soup followed by two slices of Swiss cheese on top of the croutons.  Make sure that the cheese does not sink into the soup. Place soup crocks on a cookie sheet and place under the broiler.  Broil until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling.  Let cool slightly before serving."
