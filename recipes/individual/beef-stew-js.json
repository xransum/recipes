Return all the beef to the pot. Add the braising base, potatoes, carrots and 1 1/2 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil and place the lid on top. Transfer to the oven and bake until the beef is fork-tender, about 3 hours. If the sauce is too thick, stir in an additional 1/2 cup water during the last 15 minutes of cooking.",
