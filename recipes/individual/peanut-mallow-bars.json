    "Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven, and sprinkle the marshmallows over the top. Return to the oven for about 2 minutes, just to melt the marshmallows together. Remove from the oven, and place pan on a wire rack to cool.",
