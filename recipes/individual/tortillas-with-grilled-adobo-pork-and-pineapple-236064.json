        "Preheat grill (medium heat) or broiler.",
        "Remove pork from marinade and discard marinade. Grill or broil pork about 6-inches from heat, turning occasionally, until internal temperature reaches 145\u00b0F, about 25 minutes.

Lower top plate and press ball into circle. Raise top plate and peel off top piece of plastic wrap\u2014the tortilla should be about 5 to 6 inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch-thick. Invert tortilla onto fingers of one hand and carefully peel off second piece of plastic wrap. Lay tortilla on cooler part of griddle, sweeping hand from underneath. Let tortilla sit until released from griddle, 10 to 15 seconds. Using fingers or spatula, carefully flip tortilla over, place on hotter part of griddle, and let cook until bottom begins to speckle with brown spots, 30-40 seconds. Flip tortilla over and let cook until bottom side becomes speckled, another 30 seconds or so. (Tortilla may puff a little.) Transfer to clean kitchen towel and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough, cooking 2 tortillas at a time if possible. As you take tortillas off griddle, stack on clean kitchen towel and keep covered with foil.",
