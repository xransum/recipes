        "Mix 1 cup warm water, 1 tablespoon sugar, and yeast together in a large bowl; let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable oil, egg, salt, 2 cups flour, 7 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup warm water; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until dough is soft.",
