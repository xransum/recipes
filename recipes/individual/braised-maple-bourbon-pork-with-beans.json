        "Season the pork lightly with salt and pepper. In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the pork and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Add the sausages and brown on all sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.",

        "Stir in the tomatoes, cannellini beans, maple syrup and broth. Nestle the pork into the bean mixture and arrange the sausages around the pork. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer. Transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base, cover and cook on high according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the pork and beans are tender, about 4 hours.
