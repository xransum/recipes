Bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base and remove several more layers of leaves until pale inner leaves are reached. Trim base and sides of artichoke with a very sharp stainless-steel knife and cut off the top 1 1/2 inches. Cut artichoke into quarters and cut away choke and spiky purple-tipped leaves.
