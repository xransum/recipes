        "Remove zest from lemons with a vegetable peeler (about 5 strips per lemon), reserving fruit for another use. Scrape any white pith from zest strips, then soak zest in vodka at room temperature 4 days.",
        "Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a liquid measuring cup, discarding zest, then transfer vodka to a glass bottle (preferably 2 quart).",
        "Simmer milk and sugar in a heavy medium saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 4 cups, 25 to 30 minutes. (Skim off any foam.) Cool completely, then add to vodka. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours."
