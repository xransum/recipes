        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, stir in a tablespoon of butter, and set aside.",
        "Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until lightly browned. Lay the pollock fillets in the skillet, and cook until golden on each side, about 5 minutes. When the fillets are starting to be done, break them into pieces with a fork or spatula.",
        "Add the remaining butter to the skillet, and stir in the escargot. Cook and stir for about 4 minutes. Escargot cooks fast like shrimp, so watch it. Remove from the heat, and season with parsley, oregano and basil. Top with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese."
