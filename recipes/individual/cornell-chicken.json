        "Remove chicken halves from bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken dry with more paper towels. Reserve marinade mixture.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 2 minutes. Turn each piece, brush with marinade mixture, and move to indirect heat.",
        "Grill, brushing with glaze and turning often, until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C)."
