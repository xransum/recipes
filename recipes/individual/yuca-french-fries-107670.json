        "Place the sliced yuca in a large pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes \u2014 the time can vary a great deal, because yuca can vary greatly in its woodiness. You want the yuca to still be a little firm \u2014 just tender enough to pierce it with a fork. Drain the yuca and place it on a cutting board to cool for a few minutes. When the yuca is cool enough to handle, cut it into 1/2-to-3/4-inch planks. (If there are any woody cores to the tubers, discard them.)",
        "Heat the oil in a large skillet or French fryer to 360\u00b0F, and fry the yuca. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with Sour Orange Mojo ."
