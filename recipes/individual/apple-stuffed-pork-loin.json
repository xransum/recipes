    "Place pork on a work surface and cut into 1/2-inch thickness, starting 1/2 inch from the cutting board and rolling pork open while cutting until entire loin is unrolled onto the work surface. Cover loin with plastic wrap and pound loin into 1/4-inch thickness with a meat mallet.",
    "Mix apples, bread, chicken stock, poultry seasoning, seasoned salt, and eggs together in a bowl; spread onto the loin. Roll loin around apple filling, ending with the fat cap on top. Cut stuffed pork loin in half and place on rack.",
