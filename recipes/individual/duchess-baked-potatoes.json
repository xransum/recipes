        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Whisk egg yolks, garlic, cream, sour cream, butter, and peppercorns in a large bowl; season generously with salt.

Transfer to a 3-quart baking dish and decoratively shingle or swirl surface. Bake, rotating once, until golden brown and slightly puffed, 30\u201340 minutes.",
