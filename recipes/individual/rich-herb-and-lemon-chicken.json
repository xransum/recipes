  "directions": [
    "Place each chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Sprinkle both sides of the flattened chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.",
    "Heat olive oil in a large skillet with a cover over medium heat. Pan-fry the chicken breasts for about 2 minutes on each side, until the chicken is golden brown but not cooked all the way through. Remove the chicken and set aside.",
    "Place the onion and garlic in the skillet, and cook and stir for about 3 minutes, until the onion starts to turn translucent. Pour the white wine and chicken broth into the pan, and bring to a simmer while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Whisk in the rosemary and thyme leaves, lemon juice, lemon zest, milk, and sour cream until the sauce is well mixed.",
    "Place the chicken breasts back into the skillet; cover with the sauce, Cover the skillet, and simmer for about 1 hour, until the sauce is thickened. Serve chicken with sauce spooned over the top."
