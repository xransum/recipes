        "In a food processor pur\u00e9e the scallops and the peas until the mixture is almost smooth, add the egg white, the cream, the salt, and the tarragon, and pur\u00e9e the mixture until it is smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, fold in the salmon, and transfer the mixture to a buttered 1-quart rectangular terrine, smoothing the top and rapping the terrine on a hard surface to expel any air bubbles.",
        "Cover the terrine with buttered wax paper and the lid or a double thickness of foil, put it in a baking pan, and add enough hot water to the pan to come halfway up the sides of the terrine. Bake the terrine in a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 45 minutes. Remove the terrine from the baking pan and remove the lid and the wax paper. Let the terrine stand for 10 minutes, carefully pour off the excess liquid, and invert the terrine onto a platter. The terrine may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Let the terrine return to room temperature before serving. Cut the terrine into 1/2-inch slices and serve it warm with the chive butter sauce or at room temperature with the tsatsiki.",
        "In a small heavy saucepan combine the shallot, the vermouth, and the vinegar, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer it until the liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Reduce the heat to moderately low and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, lifting the pan from the heat occasionally to cool the mixture and adding each new piece before the previous one has melted completely. (The sauce must not get hot enough to liquefy. It should be the consistency of hollandaise.) Stir in the chives and salt to taste. Makes about 1/2 cup."
