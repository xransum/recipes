        "Combine the garlic, jalape\u00f1o, scallions, chipotles, oregano, and salt in a food processor and mix until relatively smooth. While the processor is running, gradually pour in the vinegar and then the oil. Transfer this marinade to a bowl.",
        "Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Put them in a large resealable plastic bag, pour 2 cups of the marinade over them, and refrigerate overnight. Cover and refrigerate the remaining marinade.",
        "Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill.",
        "Remove the ribs from the bag, shake off the excess marinade, and place on the grill. Grill for 15 to 20 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and flipping them frequently so that they cook evenly. Serve.",
        "Recommended wine: A red wine with ripe fruit and hints of spice and black pepper, such as a Malbec from Argentina or the Cahors region in France. Of course, the combination of barbecue and beer never misses."
