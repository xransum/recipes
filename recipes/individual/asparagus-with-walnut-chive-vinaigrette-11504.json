        "In a large deep skillet of boiling salted water cook the asparagus for 3 to 7 minutes, or until the stalks are tender but not limp, drain it well, and return it to the skillet. In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the sugar, the oils, the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the dressing over the asparagus, shaking the skillet to coat the asparagus with it, and sprinkle the asparagus with the coarse salt."
