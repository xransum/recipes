        "Fill a saucepan with enough water to come about 1 inch up the side. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.",
        "Combine eggs, coconut oil, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Set the bowl on top of the saucepan so it is over, but not touching, the simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd is smooth and the consistency of pudding, 6 to 8 minutes.",
        "Remove bowl from the saucepan and continue whisking curd until slightly cooled, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold and slightly thickened, about 1 hour."
