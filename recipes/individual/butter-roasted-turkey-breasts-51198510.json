Roast turkey breasts, turning halfway through, until skin is crisp and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 160\u00b0F (for optimal moistness, you will want to cook the white meat of the turkey breasts to a lower internal temperature than you would if cooking a whole bird), 45\u201355 minutes.",
        "Transfer turkey breasts to a platter and let rest 10 minutes before carving.",
        "Serve turkey breasts with pan drippings alongside."
