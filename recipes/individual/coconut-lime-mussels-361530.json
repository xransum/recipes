        "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and lemongrass and stir to mix well. Simmer until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the lime juice. Add the wine and stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pot.",
        "Bring the wine mixture to a boil and cook for about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the coconut milk. Add the mussels to the pot, discarding any that do not close to the touch, and stir gently to coat them with the liquid. Cover and cook until all the shells have opened, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that remain closed.",
        "Divide the mussels among warmed bowls and ladle in the hot broth. Garnish with the parsley or scallions and serve at once."
