        "Whisk together the cocoa powder, Mexican oregano, basil, marjoram, cumin, hot chili powder, garlic powder, hickory salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Combine the seasoning mix with the buffalo meat, chorizo, and pork; cover and refrigerate overnight.",
        "Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, and fry the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a large, heavy pot. In the same skillet, cook and stir the onion, habanero peppers, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and New Mexico chile powder in the bacon grease until onions are translucent; add the onion mixture to the pot.",
        "In the same skillet, fry the seasoned meat in small batches until well browned, adding lard as needed; remove the meats to the pot. Stir the diced tomatoes with green chiles, salsa, tomato paste, picante sauce, diced green chiles, and dark beer into the pot. Simmer until the meat is easily pierced with a fork, 2 to 3 hours. If the chili seems too dry, add dark beer as needed."
