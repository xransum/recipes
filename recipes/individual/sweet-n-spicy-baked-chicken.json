        "Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven, brushing with sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with pepper and serve with the reserved bowl of sauce for dipping."
