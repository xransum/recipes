Add remaining zucchini and water and simmer until zucchini is very tender, about 15 minutes. Cool mixture slightly and in a blender purée in batches until smooth, transferring to a bowl. Stir in yogurt, mint, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill soup, covered, at least until cold, about 6 hours, and up to 1 day. Before serving, season with salt and pepper if necessary."
