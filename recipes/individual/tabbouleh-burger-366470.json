        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C, or gas mark 4). Line a baking pan with parchment or a silicone baking mat.",
        "Add the flour and cornstarch to the Tabbouleh Salad mixture. Knead until well incorporated. If your mixture is too wet, add a little more flour.",
        "Form into 10 patties. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, flipping halfway through, until firm and just beginning to brown. You can eat them just like this, but they get extra yummy if you panfry them in a little sesame oil after you bake them, just to get a little golden crispy crust!"
