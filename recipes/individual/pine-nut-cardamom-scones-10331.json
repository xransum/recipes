        "In a bowl whisk together the milk, the egg, the brown sugar, and the vanilla until the mixture is combined well. In another bowl stir together the flour, the salt, the baking powder, the baking soda, the cardamom, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, and the zest and blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the milk mixture and three fourths of the pine nuts with a fork until the mixture just forms a sticky but manageable dough. Knead the dough gently on a lightly floured surface for 30 seconds, pat it into a 3/4-inch-thick round, and with a 2 1/2-inch fluted cutter cut it into rounds. On an ungreased baking sheet press the remaining pine nuts lightly into the scones, brush the scones with the egg wash, and sprinkle them with the granulated sugar. Bake the scones in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they are golden."
