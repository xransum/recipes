        "Toast the bread until it is just pale golden, cut out 3 decorative shapes from each piece, and spread one side of each shape with some of the lemon-chive butter. In a small bowl toss together the salmon and the red onion and divide the mixture among 16 of the toasts. Drain the herring, discarding the onion, and divide it among 16 of the toasts. Divide the caviar among the remaining 16 toasts. Garnish the salmon canap\u00e9s with the parsley leaves, garnish the herring canap\u00e9s with the orange slices, the chives, and the zest, and arrange the canap\u00e9s on a platter. The canap\u00e9s may be prepared 1 hour in advance and kept covered and chilled."
