    "Place bacon in a Dutch oven or large pot; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir onions and garlic into bacon and cook until onions are translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until beef is thoroughly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Pour enough beer over beef mixture to almost fill the Dutch oven; add Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cover Dutch oven and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, adding more beer as needed, until beef is almost tender, about 2 hours. Add potatoes, carrots, green bell pepper, and enough beer to cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes."
