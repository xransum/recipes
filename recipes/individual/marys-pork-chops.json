        "Heat the oil in a large iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with a little salt and pepper, then brown them in the hot oil on both sides. Remove the chops to a plate, and add the syrup, tomato sauce, and tarragon. Reduce heat to medium-low, and when the sauce mixture is warm, return the pork chops to the sauce, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the chops are cooked through.",
        "Remove the chops from the sauce, and set aside, keeping warm. Add the rice to the sauce, cover, and cook until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Serve rice and sauce with pork chops over the top."
