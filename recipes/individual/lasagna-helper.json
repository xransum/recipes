        "Cook and stir the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease. Pour in the water, bring to a boil, and stir in the bouillon cubes until the cubes are dissolved. Mix in broken lasagna noodles, tomato soup, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and black pepper. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the lasagna noodle pieces are tender, about 10 minutes.",
