        "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Lightly brush a 9-inch springform pan with oil and line bottom with a round of parchment paper. Brush parchment with oil and set pan aside.",
        "In a food processor, pulse pistachios with 1/4 cup sugar until finely ground (avoid overgrinding); set aside.",
        "In two large bowls, separate the 6 eggs into yolks and whites, reserving the sixth egg white for another use. Add 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla, salt, and cardamom to bowl with egg yolks and beat using an electric mixer until thick and pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Set egg yolk mixture aside and thoroughly clean and dry the beaters.",

Gently fold almond mixture into meringue until just combined.",

Return cake to oven and bake until meringue is lightly browned and crisp, 25\u201330 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool, and immediately run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen it from the pan. Release and remove the side of the springform pan. Let cake cool at least 30 minutes before decorating.",
