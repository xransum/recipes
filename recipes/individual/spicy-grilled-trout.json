        "Cut several diagonal slashes with a sharp knife in each side of trout. Mix lemon juice, vegetable oil, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt into a paste in a small bowl; apply to the sides of the fish, spreading it into the slashes. Refrigerate trout for 1 hour.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. A grill thermometer should read 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Spray a piece of aluminum foil large enough to hold the fish with cooking spray and place it onto the grill.",
        "Place trout onto the piece of foil and grill, turning one time, until the fish is opaque and the flesh flakes easily, about 5 minutes per side."
