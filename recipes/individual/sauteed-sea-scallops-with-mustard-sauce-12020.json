In a 10-to 12-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 scallops 1 to 2 minutes on each side (depending on size), or until golden and just cooked through. Transfer scallops with tongs to a plate and keep warm, covered loosely.",

Season sauce with salt and pepper.",
