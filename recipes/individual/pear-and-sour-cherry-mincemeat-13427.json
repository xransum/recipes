        "Peel, quarter, and core pears. Chop pears coarse and in a bowl toss with lemon juice.",
        "In a dry 3 1/2- to 4-quart heavy saucepan cook 1/3 cup sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, until melted and cook, without stirring, swirling pan, until a golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and carefully add water down side of pan (caramel will steam and harden). Return pan to heat and simmer mixture, stirring, until caramel is dissolved. Add pears, remaining 1/3 cup sugar, cherries, raisins, spices, and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally at beginning of cooking and frequently toward end to prevent sticking, until thickened, about 50 minutes.",
        "Stir in walnuts and brandy and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Cool mincemeat. Mincemeat may be used immediately but will improve in flavor if kept, covered and chilled, at least 1 day and up to 1 week."
