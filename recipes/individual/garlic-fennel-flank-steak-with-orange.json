        "Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove to a plate to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing across the grain.",
        "Place oranges, flesh-side down, on the grill and cook until flesh is golden and caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Place steak and 3 orange halves on a serving platter. Squeeze remaining caramelized orange half over the steak."
