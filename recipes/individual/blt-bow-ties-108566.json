        "Cook farfalle in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain farfalle.",
        "Meanwhile, cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, stirring often. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons bacon drippings from skillet. Add tomatoes and crushed red pepper to skillet; saut\u00e9 until tomatoes soften, about 2 minutes. Add arugula, onions, 1/2 cup basil, and bacon; saut\u00e9 until arugula and basil just wilt, about 2 minutes. Stir in wine; bring to simmer. Add farfalle to sauce and toss to coat. Mix in 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/2 cup basil; cook until cheese melts and coats pasta, tossing often, about 2 minutes. Season farfalle to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle farfalle with remaining cheese and serve."
