        "In a large bowl stir together water and yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour and salt and blend until mixture forms a dough, adding additional tablespoon water if too dry. On a lightly floured surface knead dough about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. (Alternatively, dough may be made in a standing electric mixer. In bowl of mixer make dough as described above. With dough hook knead dough about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.)",
        "Put dough in a very lightly oiled deep bowl, turning to coat, and let rise, covered loosely, in a warm place 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Punch down dough and divide into 4 equal pieces. Dough keeps, each piece put in a small, sealable plastic bag and sealed, pressing out excess air, chilled overnight or frozen 2 weeks. If dough is frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator before using. Makes enough dough for four 12-by 6-inch oval pizzas.",
        "In a large saucepan simmer onions in water and oil, covered, over moderate heat until tender, about 15 minutes, and season with salt. Cook onions, uncovered, stirring occasionally and adding additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if onions begin to stick to bottom of pan, until liquid is almost evaporated and onions are golden brown. Onions may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.",
        "Preheat oven to 500\u00b0F.",
        "On a work surface sprinkled with 1 teaspoon cornmeal roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12- by 6-inch oval and transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cornmeal and dough, ending up with 2 ovals on each of 2 baking sheets.",
        "Spread onions evenly on dough ovals, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edge of each pizza. Top onions with tomatoes and sprinkle with anchovies, olives, and thyme.",
        "Bake pizzas in lower and middle thirds of oven 15 minutes, or until crusts are crisp and pale golden."
