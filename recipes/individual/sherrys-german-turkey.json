        "Rinse the turkey, pat dry and place in a large roasting pan. Insert the onion, carrot, and celery into the cavity of the bird.  Poke holes in the apple and orange so they will release their juices, and stuff them into the bird. You may have to cut some things in half to get them all inside. Spread oil all over the outside of the bird, and season with salt, pepper and soul food seasoning.",

        "Roast the turkey for about 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. Let the turkey rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving, and use the drippings in your favorite gravy recipe."
