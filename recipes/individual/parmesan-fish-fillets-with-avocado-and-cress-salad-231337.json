        "Get a frying pan really hot. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Dust the fish fillets with the seasoned flour, then dip into the egg and press into the grated Parmesan, making sure the fish is nicely covered. Add a little olive oil to the hot pan, and fry the fish fillets for a couple of minutes on each side until golden brown. Throw in the chilli. Mix together the avocado and cress with the extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, and put on your plate with your fish fillets."
