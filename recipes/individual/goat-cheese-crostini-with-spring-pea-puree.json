Add the garlic, peas, thyme and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the heat to high, add the wine and bring to a simmer, then simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil and remove from the heat.",
