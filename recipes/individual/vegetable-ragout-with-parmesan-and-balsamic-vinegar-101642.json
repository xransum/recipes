        "Squeeze juice from lemons into large pot; add lemons. Fill pot with water. Cut stem and top 1/3 from 1 artichoke. Starting at base, bend leaves back and snap off where they break naturally; continue until all tough outer leaves have been removed. Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until smooth and no dark green areas remain. Cut artichoke lengthwise into quarters. Cut out choke from quarters. Cut each quarter in half, making 1/2-inch wedges. Place artichoke pieces in lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Cover pot and bring to boil. Boil artichokes until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain; set aside. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",
