  "directions": [
    "Place nuts in a large bowl and add water to cover by 2\". Let stand at least 12 hours (this is key for silky, nongritty results; the longer the nuts soak, the smoother the milk will be).",
    "Drain nuts; discard soaking liquid. Pur√©e nuts, agave, salt, and 4 cups very hot water (but not boiling; hot water yields creamier milk) in a blender on high speed until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pressing down on solids; discard nut pulp. Thin nut milk with water as necessary to reach desired consistency. Transfer to airtight container and chill until cold.",
    "DO AHEAD: Nuts can be soaked 2 days ahead; cover. Nut milk can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled."
