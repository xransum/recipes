        "In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add the tofu and saut\u00e9 until warm, about 2 minutes. Add the curry paste and stir to coat the tofu well. Add the tomatoes and their juices, the cauliflower and the 1 1/2 cups water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the cauliflower is tender and the sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes. Add more water if the sauce gets too thick.",
        "Spoon the rice into warmed shallow bowls. Spoon the tofu-cauliflower mixture over the top and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
        "Quick tips:",
        "High-quality curry pastes are great to have in your pantry, as they add tons of good flavor to tofu, chicken and fish. Try the Patak brand, which offers a spicy hot curry, an equally spicy vindaloo and an aromatic garam masala. If you prefer milder food, try the mild curry paste. This dish reheats well, so you can enjoy an even easier dinner on the next night.",
