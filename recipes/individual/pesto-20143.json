        "Blend all ingredients in a blender, or pound in a mortar until they form a soft paste. The amount of oil used depends on the method. If you use the blender, it is best to make the pesto in two batches, using enough oil each time to cover the blades of the blender \u2014 about 1/2 cup. In the mortar method, add the oil a little at a time, until the paste has reached the proper consistency. It should not be too runny.",
