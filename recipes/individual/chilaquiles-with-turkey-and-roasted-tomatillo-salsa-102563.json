        "Heat oil in a 3 1/2-quart flameproof nonreactive shallow casserole or deep skillet to 375\u00b0F. Fry tortillas in batches, turning occasionally, until golden, about 1 minute, and transfer to paper towels to drain (return oil to 375\u00b0F between batches). Carefully pour off all but 1 tablespoon hot oil into a large metal bowl to cool before discarding.",
        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Cook onion in oil in casserole over moderately high heat, stirring, until softened. Add broth and turkey and simmer, uncovered, stirring, until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups salsa and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and toss with Monterey Jack and tortilla strips. Bake chilaquiles, uncovered, in middle of oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Whisk together cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and milk. Serve chilaquiles topped with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, cilantro, and cheese."
