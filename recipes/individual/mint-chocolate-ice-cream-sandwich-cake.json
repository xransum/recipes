        "Spread a thin layer of remaining cream mixture on bottom of a platter. Top with 4 ice cream sandwiches, placing 3 side by side and 1 along bottom of row for a square-shaped base, or 4 side by side for a rectangular-shaped base. Top with a thin layer of cream mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 cup cookies. Continue layering sandwiches, cream, and cookies, ending with a layer of cream, until all sandwiches are used (you should have 4 layers; reserve remaining 1/4 cup cookies). Wipe any excess cream off platter, then freeze until set, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.",
