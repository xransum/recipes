        "Using a sharp knife, cut all peel and white pith from lemons; discard. Working over a medium bowl, cut between membranes to release segments into bowl; squeeze in juice from membranes and discard membranes. Strain juice into another bowl.",
        "Combine segments, 1 tablespoon strained lemon juice (reserve remaining juice for another use), cucumber, 2 tablespoons scallions, and chile in a small bowl; mix well. Stir in sugar; season salsa with salt and set aside.",
        "Place chicken in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. In a mini-processor or blender, pur\u00e9e 1/4 cup cilantro, yogurt, vegetable oil, garlic, coriander, and turmeric. Pour marinade over chicken; toss to coat. Let marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before continuing.",
        "Preheat broiler. Thread 4 pieces of chicken onto each skewer and transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil, turning once and watching closely to prevent burning, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. (Alternatively, grill skewers over medium-high heat on a gas grill or over medium heat on a charcoal grill.) Transfer skewers to plates. Spoon Meyer lemon salsa over chicken. Garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro and 1 tablespoon scallions."
