        "Place tempeh in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Steam for 20 minutes, then remove, and pat dry. When tempeh has finished steaming, heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tempeh, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool.",
        "Whisk together ranch dressing, milk, garlic, dill, and salt in a large bowl. Add the cooled tempeh, drained garbanzo beans, bell pepper, celery, red onion, and romaine lettuce. Toss until the salad has been well coated in the dressing. Gently fold in the blue cheese, then season to taste with salt."
