    "Add collard greens. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally, until just wilted, about 8 minutes. Add vinegar and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is almost evaporated, 5–7 minutes.

    "Collard greens can be cooked 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Warm in a covered large wide pot with 1–2 Tbsp. water over medium heat, about 8–10 minutes, just before serving."
