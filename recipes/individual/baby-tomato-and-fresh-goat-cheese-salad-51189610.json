        "Mix the goat cheese with the herbs and shape the mixture into four 2- inch cakes and chill them for 30 minutes or so. Season the bread crumbs with salt and pepper to taste. Beat the egg with a pinch of salt. Carefully dip the goat cheese cakes into the egg, then into the bread crumbs to coat lightly. Place the cakes on a buttered cookie sheet and bake them until golden brown, about 8 minutes, or brown them in an oiled heavy skillet over medium- high heat. Whisk together the oils and lemon juice and toss with the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the dressed tomatoes on a serving platter. Place the baked goat cheese cakes on the tomatoes, garnish with the chervil, and serve."
