        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Whisk 1/4 cup water, pomegranate molasses, and next 7 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Add carrots to pomegranate mixture and toss to coat. Divide carrots between 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Roast until carrots are tender and liquids are reduced to glaze, stirring twice and mixing in water by tablespoonfuls if needed to prevent burning, about 55 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 375\u00b0F oven 10 minutes before serving.)",
