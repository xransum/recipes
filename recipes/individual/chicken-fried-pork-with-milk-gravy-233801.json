        "Pound pork chops on both sides with rough-textured side of meat pounder until 1/4 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper and cut into 3-inch pieces. Whisk together 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together egg, 3/4 cup milk, remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper in another shallow dish. Dip pork pieces in egg mixture to coat, then dredge in flour. Transfer pork as coated to a large rack set on a baking sheet. Let pork stand, uncovered, at room temperature 15 minutes. 3Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F.",
        "Heat oil in a deep 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until thermometer registers 375\u00b0F (see cooks' note, below). Fry pork in batches, turning over once, until golden, about 4 minutes per batch, transferring to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 375\u00b0F between batches. Keep pork warm on a clean baking sheet in oven.",
        "Pour off all but 2 tablespoons oil into a heatproof bowl, leaving any brown bits in bottom of skillet, then add remaining 3 tablespoons flour to skillet and cook roux over moderate heat, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Bring to a boil and whisk in remaining 2 1/2 cups milk. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season gravy with salt and pepper and serve over pork."
