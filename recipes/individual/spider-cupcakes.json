Insert licorice pieces into the outer edges of the cupcakes to make the legs of the spider, 3 legs on each side (4 takes up too much space).  Place two pieces of candy corn on the front of the cupcake for fangs and use two red hots as eyes.  Sprinkle with decorator sugar.  Repeat with remaining cupcakes."
