        "Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat. Add turkey; saut\u00e9 until just golden, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Sprinkle cornmeal and cumin over turkey and stir 1 minute. Add green onions and stir just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 cup broth and chilis and simmer until chili thickens, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat, thinning with additional broth, if desired.) Mix in cilantro. Serve chili over rice."
