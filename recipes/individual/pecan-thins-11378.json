        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
        "In a bowl beat together butter, sugar, and salt until light and fluffy and beat in whites and vanilla until just combined. Sift flour over batter and fold in. Fold in pecans.",
        "Drop batter by rounded teaspoons about 3 inches apart onto well-buttered baking sheets and with the back of a fork pat into 2 1/2-inch rounds. Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven until golden around edges, about 5 minutes. Working quickly, with a metal spatula carefully loosen cookies immediately and transfer to racks to cool completely. (If cookies become too firm to remove from baking sheets, return to over for a few seconds to soften.) Cookies may be made 1 day ahead and kept, layers separated by wax paper, in an airtight container."
