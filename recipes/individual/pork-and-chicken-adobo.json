        "Bring meat and marinating liquid to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. If necessary, add a small amount of water to prevent drying out.",
        "Strain liquid from meat. Return to the stock pot and bring to a simmer. In a skillet, cook and stir meat in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium high heat until brown on all sides, adding remaining 2 cloves of smashed garlic in the last 3 minutes. Add meats to cooking liquid, and continue simmering until slightly thickened. Serve hot."
