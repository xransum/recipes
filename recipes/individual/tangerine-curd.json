        "Have ready 3 hot, sterilized half-pint jars and their lids.",
        "Finely grate the zest from the tangerines. Cut the tangerines in half and squeeze enough juice to measure about 3 cups. In a nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the tangerine zest, tangerine juice and lemon juice. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes. Let cool.",
        "In a nonreactive heatproof bowl set over but not touching simmering water in a saucepan, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar and reduced juice and zest mixture. While stirring constantly, add the butter, a few cubes at a time, letting the cubes melt before adding more and scraping the bottom of the bowl each time. Cook, whisking, just until the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Do not let the mixture boil.",
        "Ladle the hot curd into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch of headspace. Remove any air bubbles and adjust the headspace, if necessary. Wipe the rims clean and seal tightly with the lids. Set aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes. The curd can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Makes 3 half-pint jars.",
