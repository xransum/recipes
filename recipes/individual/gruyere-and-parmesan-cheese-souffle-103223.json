        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Generously butter one 10-cup souffl\u00e9 dish or six 1 1/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to coat. (If using 1 1/4-cup dishes, place all 6 on rimmed baking sheet.) Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Cook without browning until mixture begins to bubble, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, then wine. Cook until smooth, thick and beginning to boil, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix yolks, salt and pepper in small bowl. Add yolk mixture all at once to sauce and whisk quickly to blend. Fold in 1 1/4 cups Gruy\u00e8re cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese (cheeses do not need to melt). Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm souffl\u00e9 base to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Transfer souffl\u00e9 mixture to prepared dish. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons Gruy\u00e8re cheese.",
        "Place souffl\u00e9 in oven; reduce heat to 375\u00b0F. Bake souffl\u00e9 until puffed, golden and gently set in center, about 40 minutes for large souffl\u00e9 (or 25 minutes for small souffl\u00e9s). Using oven mitts, transfer souffl\u00e9 to platter and serve immediately."
