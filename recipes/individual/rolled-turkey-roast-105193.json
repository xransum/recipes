        "1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "2. Heat the olive oil in an flame-proof baking dish, and when it is hot but not smoking, brown the turkey roast on all sides, which will take about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the shallots and the onions to the dish, and season the roast and the vegetables to your liking with salt and pepper. Crush the bay leaf and sprinkle it over the turkey roast, along with the fresh thyme leaves.",
        "3. Cover and place on the center rack in the oven. Cook until the roast is firm to the touch and cooked through, about one hour, checking it occasionally to be sure the onions or shallots aren't sticking to the bottom of the pan. If they are, simply add a tablespoon or two of water and continue cooking.",
        "4. Remove from the oven, remove the cover and let sit for at least 10 minutes, to allow the juices to retreat back into the meat. Slice, and serve, with the shallots and onions alongside."
