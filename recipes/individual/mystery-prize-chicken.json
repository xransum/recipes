Blend until some of the seeds are completely pulverized into flour, but some of the pieces are still large enough to be crunchy. Pour this mixture in a shallow dish or bowl and add the remaining 3/4 cup flour and the ground black pepper. Mix together.",
        "Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the coated chicken and brown for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side. (Note: You're not cooking the chicken with this step, just 'crunchifying' the flour and sealing in the juices so that the chicken stays tender while cooking). Lay browned chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish.",
