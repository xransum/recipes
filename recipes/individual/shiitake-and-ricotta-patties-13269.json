        "In a food processor pulse mushrooms until ground coarse. In a heavy skillet heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 mushrooms, stirring, until liquid they give off is evaporated, about 4 minutes. Cool mushrooms.",
        "In a heavy saucepan cook onion and garlic in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Add tomatoes, pepper, and salt to taste and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes.",
        "While sauce is cooking, in a bowl stir together mushrooms, ricotta, Parmesan, basil, egg, and salt and pepper to taste until combined well (mixture will be very soft). With well-floured hands shape mixture into eight 2-inch patties, shaking off excess flour.",
