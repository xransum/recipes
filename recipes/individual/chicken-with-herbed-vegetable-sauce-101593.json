  "directions": [
    "Sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper and half of thyme. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; sauté 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Add zucchini, leek, celery, carrot, garlic and remaining thyme. Sauté until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes. Return chicken to skillet, nestling chicken among vegetables. Pour in broth; bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter. Add basil and boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; spoon sauce over chicken."
