        "Place yams in large pot. Pour enough cold water over to cover by 2 inches. Sprinkle with coarse salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; boil gently until yams are very tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain well; reserve pot. Let yams stand in strainer at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes.",
        "Working in batches, press yams through potato ricer back into same pot or mash yams with potato masher. Combine cream and butter in glass measuring cup. Microwave on high just until warm, about 45 seconds. Add cream mixture to yams and mix with potato masher or whisk until puree is almost smooth. Stir in lime juice. Season to taste with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over medium-low heat until heated through, stirring often. Garnish with chives."
