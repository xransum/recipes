        "In separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Sift dry ingredient mixture over egg white mixture.  Stir just long enough to moisten flour.  The batter will look lumpy.  DO NOT OVERMIX.  Fold in blueberries.  Fill each tin two-thirds full with batter.  Bake in preheated oven 20-25 minutes or until golden brown."
