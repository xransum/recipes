        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut the core out of the cabbage and insert a long fork into the hole. Lower the cabbage into the boiling water. Remove 8 of the outer leaves as they fall off. Return the 8 leaves to the pot and cook for an additional 2 minutes to make them tender. Place them onto a sheet pan lined with a towel to cool and dry.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the Asian Sloppy Joes filling, Hearty Skillet Rice and scallions. Cut the tough bottom portion of the center rib out of each cabbage leaf. Place the leaf onto your work surface and put 2 tablespoons of the rice mixture into the center of the leaf. Roll up the bottom to cover the filling, then fold over the sides and continue rolling. When you have 8 rolls made, spread a thin layer of the Tomato Sauce onto the bottom of a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the rolls in a single layer. Place the rolls, seam-side down, in the dish and cover with the remaining Tomato Sauce. Cover the dish with foil and cook to heat the rolls through, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "For the sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, tomato paste, vinegar, garlic, ginger and hot sauce until blended. Reserve 1/2 cup for another use. Set the rest of the sauce aside.",
        "For the sloppy joes: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil. When it is hot, add the onions and peppers and cook until they are soft, about 5 minutes. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the ground pork. Break up any lumps and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until the pork is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. If there is a lot of fat in the pan, spoon some of it out and discard.",
        "Add the sauce to the pan, bring to a simmer and cook until the pork mixture has thickened but is still a bit loose, about 15 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the mixture for another use.",
        "To serve, remove 2 leaves from the cabbage, roll them up like a cigar and slice into very thin strips. Reserve the remaining cabbage for another use. Divide the sloppy joe mixture onto the hamburger buns. Garnish with the sliced cabbage. Top with the bun tops and serve immediately.",
        "Cook the rice according to package instructions.",
        "In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil. Add the onions, zucchini and red pepper flakes. Cook until the vegetables just begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ham and let cook another 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them, adding a pinch of salt and pepper. Push the vegetables to the side of the skillet, add the eggs and cook until just set. Mix the eggs and vegetables together.",
        "Add the rice to the skillet with the vegetables and egg and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is hot. Reserve 1 cup of the cooked rice for another use. Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately."
