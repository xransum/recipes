        "Shake egg white, whiskey, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker until frothy, about 1 minute. Fill shaker with ice and shake until outside is frosty, about 30 seconds. Strain into 2 coupe glasses. Gently pour 1/2 ounce wine over the back of a spoon held just above each drink's surface so wine floats on top."
