        "Divide custard among ramekins and add enough boiling-hot water to pan to reach halfway up them. Cover pan tightly with foil and poke a few holes in it. Carefully transfer pan to oven and bake until custards are set around edge but slightly wobbly in center, about 30 minutes.",
        "Cool custards on a rack, uncovered, about 1 hour, then chill, covered, until cold, at least 3 hours."
