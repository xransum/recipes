        "Cut the asparagus spears into bite-size pieces; set the tips aside. Divide the spear pieces into two separate microwave-safe containers. Place 1/2 tablespoon butter in each bowl. Loosely cover both containers and place in the microwave oven; cook on High until the asparagus is completely soft, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "While the asparagus steams, melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion and garlic in the butter until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and stir briskly for 1 minute. Add the chicken soup, milk, hot pepper sauce, salt, pepper, liquid smoke, and the steamed asparagus stalks; cook until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.",
        "Pour about 3/4 of the soup into a blender in batches, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Add the remaining 1/4 of the soup into the pureed soup; stir in the asparagus spears. Cook until thoroughly reheated, about 5 minutes."
