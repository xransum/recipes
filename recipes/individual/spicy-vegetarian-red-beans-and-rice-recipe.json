        "Place the beans in a large bowl. Cover with water and soak overnight. Rinse and drain.",
        "Set a large heavy saucepan (Dutch oven works well) over medium heat. Add the oil and\u00a0saute the garlic,\u00a0carrots,\u00a0celery,\u00a0onions and bell peppers, about 5 minutes. Season with\u00a0pepper (do not add salt at this stage or the beans will get tough while cooking). Add the\u00a0red beans,\u00a0kale leaves, chipotles and sauce,Worcestershire, smoked paprika,\u00a0onion powder,\u00a0thyme,\u00a0oregano and\u00a0cayenne. Stir well to combine everything, and then add the bay leaves and 8 cups\u00a0water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered, stirring\u00a0occasionally, until the bean mixture thickens,\u00a0about 1 1/2 hours. Add more water as it\u00a0cooks if necessary. Season well with salt once the beans are tender.",
        "When done, remove the bay leaves. Then carefully ladle out about 1 cup of the bean mixture\u00a0into a food processor and puree (or mash with a fork). Return the puree to the pan, taste\u00a0and season again with salt and black pepper. Add hot sauce to taste at this stage.",
        "Serve the red beans on top of steamed white rice and garnish with sliced scallions and a\u00a0squeeze of fresh lemon juice."
