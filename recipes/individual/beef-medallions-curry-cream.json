        "Bring the beef medallions to room temperature. Pat the medallions dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Brush with canola oil.",
        "Heat a large fry pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is just smoking, add the beef medallions and cook, turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until done to your liking. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with aluminum foil and keep warm.",
        "Set the pan over low heat, add the shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the curry and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and broth, increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Season with salt.",
        "Arrange the beef medallions on a platter or divide among warmed individual plates. Spoon the sauce over the top and serve immediately. Serves 2.",
