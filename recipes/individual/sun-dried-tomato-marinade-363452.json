        "Combine the sun-dried tomatoes, brown sugar, tomato sauce, and wine in a small nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Immediately decrease the heat so that the sauce barely bubbles, and simmer for 1 hour, until reduced to 1 cup. Remove the mixture from the pan and cool to room temperature.",
        "Combine the tomato reduction, lemon zest and juice, oregano, basil, parsley, red pepper flakes to taste, salt, peppercorns, garlic, and vinegar in a blender or a food processor and process until all the ingredients are blended. Stored in a clean, airtight container, this will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks."
