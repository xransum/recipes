        "To prepare the pesto, heat the olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan or skillet and saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic, and jalapenos over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the turmeric, stir well, and saut\u00e9 for another 2 minutes.",
        "Transfer the mixture to a food processor, add the queso blanco, and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate.",
        "To prepare the sofrito, heat the olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan or skillet. Add the onion, bell peppers, and garlic, and saut\u00e9 over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the tomato paste and remove the pan from the heat.",
        "Place the corn kernels in a large mixing bowl and stir in the sofrito mixture. Add the cornmeal and cornstarch and mix well. Place small batches of the corn mixture into a food processor or blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth.",
        "Return the pur\u00e9e to the mixing bowl and add the sugar and salt. With a wooden spoon, fold in the ground conch.",
        "Lay 2 of the reserved corn husks end to end. Place 1/2 cup of the conch filling in a cylinder shape in the middle of the husks. Roll up the husks and tie each end with butcher's twine. Repeat for the remaining tamales.",
        "Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil. Add the tamales, lower the heat, and keep at a gentle boil for 1 hour. Drain, and let the tamales cool slightly. Cut the square of cheese into a star (or other) shape and set it on a serving plate. Set the warm tamales, still in their leaves, on the cheese. Place the chilled pesto on the side, garnish with the parsley and olives, and serve."
