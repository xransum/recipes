        "Combine the milk and salt in a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. In a cup or small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water. When the milk begins to boil, stir in the cornstarch mixture, and cook stirring constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes.",
        "Remove from heat, and stir in the honey, butter, and vanilla. Pour into a serving dish, cover, and chill. To keep a skin from forming on the top, place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface."
