    "Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 325°F. Place four 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes in medium baking pan. Whisk first 3 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk in cream, lemon juice and nutmeg. Divide equally among cups.",
    "Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until custard is set around edges but still moves slightly in center when gently shaken, about 55 minutes. Transfer cups to rack; cool slightly. Cover; chill until cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. Spoon whipped cream atop custards."
