        "Blend Almond Aioli, lemon juice, and garlic in a blender to combine; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Cook rice in a large saucepan of boiling salted water, stirring often to separate grains and prevent sticking, 6 minutes. Drain well and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet to cool. Transfer cooled rice to a medium bowl.",
        "Whisk egg, egg yolk, 1/2 cup tarator sauce, and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl to combine and add to rice. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine; set aside.",
        "Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium. Just as butter starts to brown, drop four 1/4-cupfuls of rice mixture into skillet and gently press down with a spatula to make 1/2\"-thick cakes. Cook cakes until edges and bottoms are golden brown and crisp, 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack (they\u2019re only cooked on one side). Wipe out skillet and repeat process with remaining vegetable oil, butter, and rice mixture to make 4 more cakes.",
