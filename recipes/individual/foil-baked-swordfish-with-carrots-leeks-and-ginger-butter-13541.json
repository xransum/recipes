        "In a heavy skillet cook the carrots and the leeks with salt and pepper to taste in 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until the carrots are crisp-tender, and keep the mixture warm. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the zest, the gingerroot, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold 2 pieces of 20- by 12-inch foil in half by bringing the short ends together, unfold each piece, and arrange a swordfish steak, seasoned with salt and pepper, just to one side of each fold line. Top the swordfish with the vegetable mixture and dot it with the butter mixture. Fold the foil over the swordfish steaks with the vegetable mixture to enclose them, fold the edges of the foil together to form tightly sealed packets, and bake the packets on a baking sheet in a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 10 minutes. Open the packets carefully, transfer the swordfish steaks with vegetables mixture to plates, and pour the juices over them, discarding the foil."
