Divide mixture equally among eight 4 1/2-inch diameter tartlet pans with removable bottoms (about 1/3 cup mixture for each). Press mixture onto bottoms and up sides of pans. Bake until crusts are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer pans to racks; cool completely.",

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth. Gradually add white chocolate mixture and beat until well blended. Beat remaining 3/4 cup whipping cream, sugar and vanilla in medium bowl until medium-firm peaks form. Fold into cream cheese mixture in 2 additions. Divide filling among prepared tartlet crusts (about 1/2 filing for each). Refrigerate at least 2 hours.",
