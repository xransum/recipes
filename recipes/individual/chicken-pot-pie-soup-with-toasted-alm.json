        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place frozen puff pastry shells, top-side-up on an ungreased baking sheet 2 inches apart.",
        "Bake shells in preheated oven until puffed and golden-brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to cool on a wire rack.",
        "Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the cubed chicken, and cook, until firmed and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken meat and set aside.",
        "Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and whisk in the chicken soup base, thyme, and parsley. Mix together the softened butter and flour in a small bowl to form a paste. Whisk this paste into the simmering soup, and cook 10 minutes or until thickened.",
        "Stir in the cooked chicken, mushroom pieces, peas and carrots, cream, and toasted almonds. Return soup to a simmer, and cook a few minutes until hot. Ladle soup into serving bowls, and top with puff pastry to serve."
