Cover and cook until rice is tender, peas are cooked through and broth is absorbed, about 4 minutes longer. Meanwhile, heat heavy large skillet over high heat. Add ham and bell pepper and cook until ham begins to brown, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.",
        "Remove skillet from heat. Add rice mixture, tomatoes and 2 tablespoons vinaigrette. Toss, adding more vinaigrette by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature."
