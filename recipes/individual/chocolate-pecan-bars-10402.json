Press the dough evenly with floured hands into the bottom of a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is golden.",
        "In a bowl cream the butter with the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the flour, the vanilla, and the salt and stir in the pecans and the chocolate chips.",
