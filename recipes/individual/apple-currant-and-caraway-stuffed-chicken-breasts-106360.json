        "Peel and core apple and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Melt butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saut\u00e9 caraway seeds, stirring, 1 minute. Add onion and saut\u00e9, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add apple and celery and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.

        "Pat chicken dry and season with salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken in 2 batches, about 2 minutes on each side, transferring to a small roasting pan as browned (reserve skillet).",
        "Roast chicken in middle of oven until just cooked through, 14 to 16 minutes.",
        "While chicken is roasting, stir flour into fat remaining in skillet and cook roux over moderately low heat, stirring, 1 minute. Whisk in cider and broth and bring to a boil, whisking, then boil, whisking occasionally, until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup, about 8 minutes.",
