Add oranges, peel, and rosemary. Simmer 8 minutes to blend flavors. Using slotted spoon, transfer oranges to medium bowl. Boil liquid in saucepan until reduced to 1 1/3 cups, about 8 minutes. Pour syrup over oranges. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)"
