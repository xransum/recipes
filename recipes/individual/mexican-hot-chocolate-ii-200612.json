        "In a large heavy saucepan, combine the milk, the brown sugar, the ground cinnamon, the vanilla, and a pinch of salt and bring the mixture just to a boil over moderate heat. In a small heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate with about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture and whisk the mixture until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the chocolate mixture to the remaining milk mixture and simmer the hot chocolate, whisking, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the Kahl\u00faa. (For a frothy result, in a blender blend the hot chocolate in batches.) Divide the hot chocolate among mugs and serve it with the cinnamon sticks as stirrers."
