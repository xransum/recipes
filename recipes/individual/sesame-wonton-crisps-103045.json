        "Heat oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360\u00b0F. Brush 1 side of 2 wrappers with cornstarch mixture and sprinkle with seed mixture. Shake off any excess seeds and add wrappers to oil, seeded sides down. Fry, turning over once, until golden, about 10 seconds. (Some seeds will fall off during frying.) Transfer crisps with tongs to paper towels to drain, then make more, 2 at a time, in same manner."
