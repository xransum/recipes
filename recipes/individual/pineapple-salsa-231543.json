    "Place the pineapple, mint, jalapeño(s), lime juice, and brown sugar in a nonreactive mixing bowl, but don't mix them until 5 minutes before you are ready to serve. Taste for seasoning, adding more lime juice and/or brown sugar as necessary.",
    "Slivered mint keeps this \"salsa\" in the realm of a salad. If you really want to push the limits try substituting chopped fresh cilantro for the mint."
