        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan until fragrant and a shade darker, about 8 minutes.",
        "When hazelnuts are cool enough to handle, wrap in a kitchen towel and rub to remove skins. (Not all skins will come off.) Transfer hazelnuts to a large bowl with almonds, cashews, pecans, and walnuts. Line baking pan with foil and lightly oil.",
        "Bring sugar, water, and honey to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour over nuts and stir until nuts are well coated. Transfer nuts with a slotted spoon to baking pan (discarding syrup) and roast in 1 layer in middle of oven, stirring and redistributing nuts occasionally, until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.",
        "Lightly oil another sheet of foil and put on a work surface. Spread nuts in 1 layer on foil and cool completely. Break apart any nuts that are stuck together."
