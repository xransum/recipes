        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a ceramic, glass, or metal mixing bowl into the freezer to chill.",
        "Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat until the foam subsides. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with seasoned salt on both sides, and brown in the melted butter, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken breasts into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Place the mushrooms in the skillet with the chicken drippings, and cook and stir until the mushrooms have begun to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour the mushrooms and pan drippings over the chicken breasts.",
