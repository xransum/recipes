        "Rinse chiles and split open, discarding stems, seeds, and ribs. Heat a dry well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over moderate heat, then toast chiles in batches, turning them, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and pour boiling water over them. Cover bowl and soak chiles, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 15 minutes.",
        "Reserve one fourth of soaking liquid, then pur\u00e9e chiles with remaining liquid in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Pour pur\u00e9ethrough a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids. Whisk in reserved soaking liquid.",
        "Toast bread crumbs in oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chile pur\u00e9e, vinegar, and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 25 minutes.",
