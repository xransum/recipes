Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then, starting skin sides down, brown chicken, in batches if necessary, turning over once, about 6 minutes total per batch, transferring to a large plate. Add onions and bell pepper to pot and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally and scraping up brown bits (from chicken), until onions are golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and malagueta peppers or Thai chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 minutes. Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Add chicken, along with juices accumulated on plate, and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.",
