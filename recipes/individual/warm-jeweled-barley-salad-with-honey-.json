        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook barley in boiling water, uncovered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Add dried fruit and cook 1 minute more. Drain barley mixture well and transfer to a large bowl.",
        "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toast almonds in a small rimmed baking sheet or pie pan until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool.",
        "While barley cooks and nuts toast, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until browned around edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add onion to barley and toss to combine.",
        "Whisk together mustard, honey, vinegar, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk in remaining tablespoon oil and pour dressing over salad. Toss well. Sprinkle salad with toasted almonds and toss lightly."
