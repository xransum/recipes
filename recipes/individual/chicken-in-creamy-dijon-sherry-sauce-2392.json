    "Season chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and sauté until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Add mushrooms, onion and peppercorns to skillet and sauté until onion is tender, about 7 minutes. Add broth, cream, Sherry and mustard to skillet. Simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, scraping up browned bits, about 15 minutes. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to pan. Cook until chicken is just heated through, about 4 minutes longer."
