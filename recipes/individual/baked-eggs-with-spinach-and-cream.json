  "directions": [
    "Preheat an oven to 350°F. Coat four 1/2-cup ramekins with the 1 Tbs. butter.",
    "Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook until limp but still bright green, about 4 minutes. Drain well and rinse under cold running water. Drain again and squeeze to remove excess water. Coarsely chop the spinach.",
    "Divide the chopped spinach among the prepared ramekins. Dot each with 1/2 tsp. of the remaining butter. Break an egg into each ramekin and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle each with 1 tsp. of the cream. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet.",
    "Bake until the whites are set and the yolks are firm around the edges but still soft in the center, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
