        "In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm, scalded milk.  Add 2 cups flour.  Stir well, and allow to rest 1 hour in a warm place. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm.",
        "Soften chopped raisins in warm water for 30 minutes.",
        "Beat egg, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, melted butter or margarine, salt, and orange rind.  Add to yeast sponge. Stir in raisins. Stir in egg mixture.  Blend well.  Add 4 cups flour.   Mix well, forming smooth ball.  Dough will be somewhat soft, but not \"batter-like.\"  Cover dough, and allow to rise until fully doubled.  Punch down, let rise until double again.",
        "Roll dough into 1/2 inch balls, set aside to rise until doubled in bulk. In a deep-fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Drop 2 or 3 at a time into hot fat, turn when deep golden brown.  If removed too soon, dough will be undone inside. When done drain briefly and dust with confectioners' sugar before serving."
