        "In a saucepan stir together the cocoa powder, 1/3 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch, and a pinch of salt, add the milk in a stream, whisking, and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking until it is thick and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool. In a bowl beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, add the mint extract, and beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, a little at a time, beating until the whites hold stiff peaks. Stir one third of the whites into the cocoa mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.",
        "Make 8 cr\u00eapes (procedure follows) with the chocolate cr\u00eape batter. Spread 1/3 cup of the filling onto half of each cr\u00eape and fold the cr\u00eapes gently over the filling. Bake the cr\u00eapes on a baking sheet in a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 10 minutes, transfer them to plates, and serve them with the sauce.",

        "In a blender or food processor blend the flour, the cocoa, the sugar, the salt, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, the milk, the eggs, and the butter for 5 seconds. Turn off the motor, with a rubber spatula scrape down the sides of the container, and blend the batter for 20 seconds more. Transfer the batter to a bowl and let it stand, covered for 1 hour. The batter may be made",

        "Heat a cr\u00eape pan or non-stick skillet measuring 6 to 7 inches across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with the butter, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and remove it from the heat. Stir the batter, half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it, and pour the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a layer of batter and return any excess batter to bowl. Return the pan to the heat, loosen the edge of the cr\u00eape with a spatula, and cook the cr\u00eape for 1 minute, or until the top appears almost dry. Turn the cr\u00eape, cook the other side lightly, and transfer the cr\u00eape to a plate. Make cr\u00eape with the remaining batter in the same manner, brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary. The cr\u00eapes may be made 3 days in advance, kept stacked, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled.",
