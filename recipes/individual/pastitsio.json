Stir in the ground beef, and cook until crumbly and no longer pink.  Pour in the water and tomato paste.  Season with salt, pepper, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon; cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, adjust salt to taste, then refrigerate until cold.  Once cold, remove any congealed fat, and thoroughly mix with 2 beaten eggs, and set aside.",
