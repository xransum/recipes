        "Position oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Heat oven to 450\u00b0. Place a long piece of aluminum foil on a large, shallow baking sheet (foil should be longer than sheet); repeat with another baking sheet; place 1 whole fish on each sheet. Season each fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Whisk remaining ingredients in a bowl; spoon over each fish. Seal foil loosely around each fish to create a somewhat roomy pocket. Bake 10 minutes per inch of thickness of fish at its thickest part (typically 20 to 25 minutes for a 2-inch-thick fish). Remove foil and serve with juices."
