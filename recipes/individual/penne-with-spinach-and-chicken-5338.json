        "Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, lemon peel and rosemary. Saut\u00e9 until onion softens, about 7 minutes. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to pot and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add half of spinach and toss until beginning to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add remaining spinach and toss until all spinach is wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes longer. Mix in pasta, then 2/3 cup cheese. Moisten with reserved pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing remaining 1 cup cheese separately."
