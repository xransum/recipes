        "With a sharp knife, make several small slits near the edges of the pork chops to keep them from curling when fried.",
        "Into a large resealable plastic bag, add the soy sauce, garlic, sugar, white wine, and five-spice powder. Place chops into the bag, and close the seal tightly. Carefully massage the marinade into chops, coating well. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, turning the bag over every so often.",
        "In a large skillet, heat enough vegetable oil to fill the skillet to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Remove chops from resealable bag without wiping off marinade. Lightly sprinkle cornstarch on both sides of the chops.",
        "Carefully add chops to skillet; cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides and cooked through."
