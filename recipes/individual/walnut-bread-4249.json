Shape each half into 6-inch round loaf. Place dough rounds on prepared baking sheet, spacing 4 inches apart. Flatten slightly. Cover with dry towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Bake until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on bottom, about 25 minutes. Transfer to racks; cool. Serve at room temperature."
