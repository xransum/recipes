        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Generously butter one 10-cup souffl\u00e9 dish or six 1 1/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes; sprinkle with minced thyme to coat. (If using 1 1/4-cup dishes, place all 6 on rimmed baking sheet.) Heat olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and minced garlic. Cook without browning until mixture begins to bubble, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in whole milk, then white wine. Cook until smooth, thick and beginning to boil, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix egg yolks and salt in small bowl. Add egg yolk mixture all at once to sauce; whisk quickly to blend. Mix in 1 tablespoon basil, 1 tablespoon thyme and 1 teaspoon rosemary. Fold in cold goat cheese and Gruy\u00e8re cheese (cheeses do not need to melt).",
        "Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm souffl\u00e9 base to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Transfer souffl\u00e9 mixture to prepared dish. Sprinkle with ground black pepper.",
        "Place souffl\u00e9 in oven; reduce heat to 375\u00b0F. Bake souffl\u00e9 until puffed, golden and gently set in center, about 35 minutes for large souffl\u00e9 (or 25 minutes for small souffl\u00e9). Using oven mitts, transfer souffl\u00e9 to platter and serve immediately."
