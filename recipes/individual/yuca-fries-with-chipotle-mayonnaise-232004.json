        "Cook fresh or frozen yuca with 1 tablespoon oil in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until tender when pierced with a knife and almost translucent, 8 to 12 minutes for fresh or 10 to 15 for frozen. Transfer with a slotted spoon to several layers of paper towels to drain and let stand 5 minutes. If using frozen yuca, cut pieces into 1/3-inch-thick fries, discarding any fibrous core.",
