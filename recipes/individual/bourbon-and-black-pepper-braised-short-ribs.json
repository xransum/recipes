        "Season the short ribs with salt and pepper.",
        "In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker or in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, warm the oil until almost smoking. Add half of the short ribs and brown on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining ribs.",
        "Transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base; if using a saut\u00e9 pan, transfer the ribs to a slow cooker. Return all the ribs to the slow cooker and add the onion, barbecue sauce and water. Cover and cook on low according to the manufacturer's instructions until the meat nearly falls off the bone, about 6 hours.",
        "Transfer the ribs to a platter. Using paper towels, blot the excess sauce off the ribs. Skim the fat off the braising liquid and simmer the liquid until slightly thickened.",
        "Meanwhile, preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat until smoking. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Working in batches, grill the ribs until nicely grill-marked, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the ribs to a platter and serve with corn fritters. Pass the sauce alongside. Serves 6."
