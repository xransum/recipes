  "directions": [
    "Begin by placing your two meats and onion into the basin. Press the Sauté button and cook until the meats are no longer pink, shifting the contents regularly to break them up. This will take around 5 minutes or so. Now add in the remaining ingredients. Give them a quick stir and press the Keep Warm/Cancel button (high pressure, 30 minutes). Now secure the lid, close off the pressure valve and press the Bean/Chili button. Allow the contents to cook and once complete, quick-release the pressure valve. Remove the lid when safe to do so and press Keep Warm/Cancel, and then press the Sauté button. This will help reduce the chili liquid and help thicken it up. Sauté your chili for about 10 minutes, stirring each minute or so. Serve with dairy-free sour cream, jalapeño slices and dairy-free cheese."
