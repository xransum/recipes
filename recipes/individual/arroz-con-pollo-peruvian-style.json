        "Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot with a lid over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until just browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a platter, reserving drippings in the pot.",
        "Saute onion and garlic in the retained drippings until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir cilantro into the onion mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir mixture for 2 minutes more.",
        "Return chicken to the pot; add rice, water, beer, carrot, and peas. Place lid on the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the rice absorbs the liquid completely and is tender, about 20 minutes."
