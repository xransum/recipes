        "Put tentacles from octopus head (just below eyes) and discard head. Fill a 6- to 8-quart pot three-fourths full with water and bring octopus to a boil (do not salt water; it will make octopus tough). Simmer until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Drain and cool slightly. Rinse under cold running water to remove as much of purple outer coating as possible without removing suction cups. Drain well and cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces.",
        "While octopus simmers, chop tomatoes, reserving juices.",
        "Saut\u00e1 garlic and red pepper flakes in oil in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Stir in parsley and basil. Add tomatoes with juices and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.",
        "Add octopus and cook until very tender when thick parts are pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Meanwhile, boil linguine in a large pot of salted water until al dente, then drain well.",
        "Serve octopus sauce over linguine."
