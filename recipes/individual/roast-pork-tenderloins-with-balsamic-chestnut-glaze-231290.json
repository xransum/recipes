        "Combine oil and 1/4 cup vinegar in heavy large roasting pan. Add pork; turn to coat. Marinate pork 1 hour at room temperature or 2 hours in refrigerator. Transfer pork to large rimmed baking sheet; pat dry. Discard marinade in pan.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Spread mustard over top of pork, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 145\u00b0F, about 25 minutes. Remove pork from oven; let stand 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in chestnuts, garlic, sugar, and sage; cook 2 minutes. Add remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar and 3 tablespoons water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Season glaze with salt and pepper.",
        "Slice pork into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Transfer to platter. Drizzle with warm glaze and serve.",
        "*To prepare fresh chestnuts, start with heavy, glossy nuts with firm, smooth shells. Cut a small cross on one side of each shell to let steam escape as the nuts roast and to make them easier to peel afterward. Place chestnuts in a shallow roasting pan; sprinkle with water. Roast in 400\u00b0F oven for 25 to 20 minutes. Wrap hot chestnuts in towl and squeeze to crush the shells. Keep nuts wrapped for 5 minutes before removing the hard outer shell and the brown skin inside, being wary of burning your fingers. One pound of fresh chestnuts equals about two cups when shelled."
