        "Wash a bunch of watercress, removing the thick stems. Dry the leaves and put them in a bowl. Add a drop or two of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Season to taste with kosher salt.",
        "Take 1 slice of brioche bread and layer it with some of the watercress. Top with another slice of brioche. Add some of the egg-mayonnaise mixture on top, then sandwich with a third slice of brioche. Using a serrated knife, cut off the crusts and slice into rectangles, about 1 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Repeat with another 9 slices of bread."
