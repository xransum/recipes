Transfer chicken, skin side up, with tongs to a large shallow baking pan (reserve skillet) and roast until chicken is just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Let chicken stand 5 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, cook garlic in reserved skillet over moderately high heat, stirring, until pale golden, 15 to 30 seconds. Add paprika, then immediately add vinegar, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, and boil 1 minute. Add broth and honey and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Season with salt and serve with chicken."
