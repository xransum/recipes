        "Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Combine the sesame oil, rosemary, basil, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and mix well. Pour the herb mixture over the chicken breasts; cover and marinate 20 minutes.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts in the skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Melt the butter in the skillet, and add the shallots. Cook the shallots until softened and browned, about 5-8 minutes.",
        "Increase the heat to medium-high, and stir the wine into the chicken-shallot mixture. Cook all ingredients for 5 minutes longer, allowing the wine to reduce. Check the chicken for doneness: it is cooked when the juices run clear when pierced with a fork."
