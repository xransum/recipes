        "Bring raw sugar, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and 1 1/3 cups water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and let spices steep 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small measuring glass or bowl (you\u2019ll have 1 1/2\u20131 3/4 cups syrup); let syrup cool. Cover and chill until cold, at least 30 minutes.",

        "If serving from a dispenser with a spigot, line sides at the bottom with a row of orange wheels and fill one-quarter full with crushed ice to hold orange wheels against sides. Create another layer of orange wheels and add just enough ice to hold them against sides. Repeat until dispenser is full. Pour punch over ice and top with fir sprigs, if desired. Serve punch in ice-filled glasses garnished with cranberries, cinnamon sticks, and orange wheels.",
