        "Wash and pat dry the rabbit pieces; place into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade and seal the bag. Turn the bag over several times to coat rabbit with marinade and allow to marinate in refrigerator 2 to 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Reduce to low. Remove rabbit from marinade and shake off excess liquid; discard the used marinade.",
        "Lay the rabbit pieces onto lower rack of grill. Grill until the rabbit shows good grill marks, the meat is no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
