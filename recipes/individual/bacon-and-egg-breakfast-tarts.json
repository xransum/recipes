Roll each part into a 6 inch circle on a well floured, cloth covered board with a floured, cloth covered rolling pin.  Fit pastry over backs of large muffin cups (3 x 1 1/2 inch), or 6 ounce custard cups; make pleats so pastry will fit closely.  If using individual pie pans or tart pans, cut circles 1 inch larger than inverted pans, and fit into pans.  Prick surface.  Place tarts on an ungreased cookie sheet.",
