        "Place the meat in a large casserole dish. In a food processor, grind the walnuts, pomegranate molasses, garlic, and oil into a puree. Add the parsley leaves and pulse into small bits. Pour the marinade over the meat and toss well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
        "If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak them in salty water for a couple of hours before grilling. Thread 3 or 4 pieces of meat onto each skewer 1/4-inch apart, leaving 2 inches of space at the end. Discard the marinade. Brush or wipe extra marinade from the skewers. Allow the meat to come to room temperature (no more than 45 minutes total).",
        "Meanwhile, heat the grill to high heat. Lightly oil the grill and grill the kebabs for 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is slightly charred on the outside and very pink on the inside.",
        "Transfer to a serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve."
