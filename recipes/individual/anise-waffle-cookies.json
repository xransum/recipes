        "Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk together flour, anise seed, and salt in a bowl.",
        "In a separate bowl, mash the shortening until creamy, and stir with all of the sugar, eggs, and anise oil until thoroughly mixed. Stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients to form a dough. Break off about 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie, and roll into 1-inch balls.",
        "Spray the waffle iron with cooking spray. Place dough balls onto the iron, close the lid, and bake until the iron stops emitting steam and the cookies are lightly golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Check after about 1 minute. Remove the cookies from the iron and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar while still warm. Cool on wire rack."
