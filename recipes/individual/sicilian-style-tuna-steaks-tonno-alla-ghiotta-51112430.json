        "1. In a medium skillet over moderately high heat, warm the oil. Season the tuna with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9, turning once, until golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total. Remove the tuna and set aside. Do not clean the pan.",
        "2. In the same pan over low heat, saut\u00e9 the onion, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, capers, olives, raisins, and tomatoes, and continue cooking, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes. If the tomatoes don't release much juice, add the fish stock or water to give the sauce some body.",
        "3. Return the tuna to the pan and cover it with a tight-fitting lid. Cook over moderate heat until the tuna reaches the desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes for medium.",
        "4. Add the parsley and basil and stir to incorporate, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the fish with the sauce spooned over the top; garnish with pine nuts."
