        "Beat yolks and sugar in medium bowl until thick and light yellow, about 2 minutes. Bring cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk hot cream into yolk mixture. Return mixture to same saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sauce thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 3 minutes (do not boil). Strain mixture into clean medium bowl. Add coffee powder; stir until dissolved. Stir in ground espresso beans. Refrigerate until cold, whisking occasionally, about 1 hour. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)"
