        "1. Fill a large, heavy pot with apple juice. Tie the cinnamon sticks, ginger, and cloves together in a cheesecloth bag with kitchen string and add to the juice. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes, partially covered, to infuse flavors.",
        "2. Meanwhile, squeeze the lemon into a large bowl and fill with water. Core the apples and pears from the bottom and peel them. Drop immediately into the lemon water (to prevent browning) until poaching time.",
        "3. Carefully add apples to the boiling poaching liquid, reduce heat, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove to a bowl. Add the pears to the liquid and poach until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove to a bowl.",
        "4. Cool the poaching liquid to room temperature and discard spice bag. Return fruit to the liquid and refrigerate overnight.",
        "5. To serve, place the fruit, stem-ends up, on a cake stand or platter. Strain some of the liquid over the fruit."
