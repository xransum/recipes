        "Bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 45 minutes; remove foil, and bake until meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing."
