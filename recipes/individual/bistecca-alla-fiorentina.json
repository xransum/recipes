        "Take the meat out of the refrigerator about 2 hours before cooking it. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling over medium-high heat. Oil the grill rack.",
        "Rub the meat on both sides with the olive oil. (Do not add any salt at this point.)",
        "Using tongs, lay the steak directly over the hottest part of the fire or the heat elements, about 5 inches above the fire. Cook until browned and juicy on the first side, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn the steak and sprinkle with salt. Cook on the second side until browned and juicy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Then turn the meat over once again and sprinkle with salt.",
        "Transfer the steak to a cutting board and season generously with pepper. Garnish with lemon wedges and the arugula and serve immediately. Serves 2.",
