In a chilled bowl with the electric mixer beat the cream with the vanilla until it just holds stiff peaks, fold the egg white mixture into the cream, and divide the mixture among four 8-ounce mugs. In a pitcher stir together the coffee, heated if necessary, and the liqueur, divide the mixture among the mugs, and sprinkle each drink with some of the additional cinnamon."
