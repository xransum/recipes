        "Prick the duck skin with a fork. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the duck breasts, skin-side down, and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Spoon off the fat and discard. Turn the duck breast and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand.",
        "Return the pan to the heat. Add the chopped ginger and the syrup and cook over low heat for 1 minute. Increase the heat; add the hoisin and 2 tablespoons of water. Cook for 1 minute. Add the scallions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until the onions have wilted. Reduce the heat to very low to keep the sauce warm.",
        "Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and drop in the glass noodles. Cook for 2 minutes, drain well, and spoon onto warmed serving plates. Slice the duck breast diagonally and arrange over the noodles. Spoon the ginger and hoisin sauce over the top."
