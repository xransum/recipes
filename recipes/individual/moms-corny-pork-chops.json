        "Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Scrape up and dissolve all the juices and browned flavor bits from the skillet into the water. Pour the mixture over the pork chops. Spread creamed corn evenly over the pork chops.",
        "Bake the pork chops in the preheated oven until the pork is tender and no longer pink in the middle, about 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)."
