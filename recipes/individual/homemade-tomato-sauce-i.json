        "Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Have ready a large bowl of iced water.  Plunge whole tomatoes in boiling water until skin starts to peel, 1 minute.  Remove with slotted spoon and place in ice bath.  Let rest until cool enough to handle, then remove peel and squeeze out seeds.  Chop 8 tomatoes and puree in blender or food processor.  Chop remaining two tomatoes and set aside.",
        "In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, carrot and garlic in oil and butter until onion starts to soften, 5 minutes.  Pour in pureed tomatoes.  Stir in chopped tomato, basil, Italian seasoning and wine.  Place bay leaf and whole celery stalks in pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 2 hours.  Stir in tomato paste and simmer an additional 2 hours.  Discard bay leaf and celery and serve."
