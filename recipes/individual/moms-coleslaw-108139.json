Let stand a few minutes to allow the cabbage to begin to change chemically as it absorbs the ingredients. Add one of the special seasonings in the list. Toss again with 4 tablespoons yogurt. When the cabbage is fully coated, toss with 3 tablespoons mayonnaise. Stir in 2 tablespoons dill weed and serve."
