        "For vegetables and couscous: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Rub cut sides of eggplant with 1 tbsp oil and sprinkle with cumin. Season with salt and pepper and place in baking pan, cut sides down; bake for 30 minutes or until eggplant is browned and cooked through. Remove and let sit until cool enough to handle. Spoon out flesh onto cutting board and roughly chop; transfer to a medium-sized bowl. While eggplant is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and set up an ice bath by combining 5 cups ice cubes and 7 cups cold water in a large bowl. Blanch green beans in boiling water until bright green, about 3 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and cool in the ice bath at least 1 minute (until cool in center). Repeat with wax beans. Cook corn for 15 seconds, then cool 1 minute in ice bath. Drain and blot dry all vegetables. Add tomatoes and toss together gently. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook couscous according to package instructions; mix with eggplant and stir in 2 tbsp oil, red wine vinegar, and basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
        "For fish: Preheat grill or broiler. Brush fish on both sides with remaining oil. Season skin side with salt and pepper. Starting with skin side down, grill or broil fish 4 minutes. Season flesh side with salt and pepper; turn and grill or broil about 4 minutes longer or until cooked through.",
        "To serve: Spoon equal amounts of vegetables and couscous onto 4 plates and top with grilled fish. Serve hot."
