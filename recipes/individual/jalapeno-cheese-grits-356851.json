        "1. Heat 4 cups of water in a large heavy-bottomed pot over high heat until it comes to a boil. Slowly pour in the grits while whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 20 minutes.",
        "2. While the grits are cooking, pan-roast the jalape\u00f1o pepper in a small skillet over high heat until the skin is brown and blistered. Cut the pepper in half lengthwise and remove the skin and the seeds from the pepper and discard. Mince the flesh and add it to the pot of grits.",
        "3. Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the butter, mascarpone, and Edam cheese. Season with salt."
