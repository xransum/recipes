        "Cook garlic in the skillet for 30 seconds; add mushrooms and saute until tender. Transfer to the dish with the sausage.",
        "Pour water and Ragu(R) Classic Alfredo sauce into the skillet; whisk to blend. Bring to a boil.",
        "Add broken lasagna noodles to the skillet; reduce heat to medium. Simmer until the noodles are tender, about 12 to 15 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent pasta from sticking to bottom of the pan.",
        "Return sausage and mushrooms to the pan; reduce heat to low. Stir in spinach; cook until just wilted. Add ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, stirring until the mozzarella is melted and the ricotta is well combined."
