        "Whisk the wine, water, flour, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined and no lumps are visible. Dip each mushroom individually into the mixture to coat.

Remove from oil and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese to serve."
