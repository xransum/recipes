        "Cook hamburger patties in the preheated grill for 5 minutes, seasoning with Worcestershire sauce. Flip patties. Arrange tortillas on the grill and lower heat to medium-low under tortillas. Add Cheddar cheese and Colby-Jack cheese to tortillas; cook until cheeses melt, 2 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking hamburger patties until cooked through, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
