        "Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high and boil until syrup turns light golden, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 7 minutes (time will vary according to size of pan). Add 2 packages raspberries and hibiscus flowers (mixture will harden slightly). Bring mixture to boil, stirring constantly to dissolve any caramel bits. Reduce heat to medium and simmer 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes for flavors to blend. Strain raspberry sauce, pressing on solids to remove seeds. Stir in vinegar.",

Trim pastry to form 16x10-inch rectangle. Cut crosswise into 4 equal strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 4 equal pieces to form sixteen 4x21/2-inch rectangles.",

Spoon about 3 tablespoons berry mixture over cream. Top with remaining pastry rectangles. Spread each with 1/4 cup cream, spoon remaining berry mixture over, and serve immediately.",
