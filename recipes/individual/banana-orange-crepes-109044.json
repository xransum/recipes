        "Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with butter, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Holding skillet off heat, pour in half of batter (1/4 cup), immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next cr\u00eape.) Return skillet to heat and cook cr\u00eape until just set and golden around edges, 10 to 15 seconds. Loosen edge of cr\u00eape with a heatproof plastic spatula, then flip cr\u00eape over carefully with your fingertips. Cook until underside is set, about 20 seconds more. Transfer cr\u00eape to a plate. Brush skillet with more butter and make another cr\u00eape in same manner. Reserve skillet.",

Add 1 cr\u00eape to sauce and cook until cr\u00eape is coated and heated through, about 15 seconds. Fold cr\u00eape into quarters using tongs, then transfer to a heated dessert plate. Repeat with second cr\u00eape.",
