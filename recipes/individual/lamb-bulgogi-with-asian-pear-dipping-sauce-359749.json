Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds over lamb. Serve grilled lamb and vegetables with hot pepper paste. Allow guests to spread very small amounts of kochujang over lettuce leaves, arrange lamb and vegetables in lettuce leaves, then wrap filling with lettuce leaves and dip into sauce."
