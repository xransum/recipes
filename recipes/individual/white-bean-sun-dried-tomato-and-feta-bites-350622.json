Add pine nuts and toast, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Continue stirring until mixture cools slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, tomatoes, lemon juice, basil, Parmesan, and Feta. (Topping can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 6 hours. Before serving, bring to room temperature.)",
