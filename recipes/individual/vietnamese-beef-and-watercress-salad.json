        "Marinate the beef",
        "In a sealable plastic bag, combine the garlic, fish sauce, sugar, salt, a pinch of pepper and 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the beef, seal the bag and squeeze to distribute the ingredients. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to 1 1/2 hours; if refrigerated, return to room temperature before cooking.",
        "Marinate the onion",
        "In a bowl, toss the onion with the vinegar and season generously with pepper. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil and toss to combine.",
        "Assemble the salad and stir-fry the beef",
        "In a wok or deep, heavy fry pan over high heat, warm the canola oil. Meanwhile, arrange the watercress and cilantro on individual plates and top with the onion. When the oil is very hot, add the beef and the marinade and stir-fry until the beef is browned on all sides, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes; do not overcook. Scatter the beef over the salads and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
