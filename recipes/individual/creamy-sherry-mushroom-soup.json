    "directions": [
        "Wipe mushroom caps with a damp cloth. Trim stems and coarsely chop mushrooms. In a 6-quart pot, melt butter with onion. Add mushrooms and sherry cooking wine. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, 8-10 minutes or until most, but not all, of the liquid is absorbed. Sprinkle flour over mushrooms; stir in milk, broth, soy sauce and sage. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat. Simmer gently 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "Remove soup from heat. Use an immersion blender to puree soup. Or pour soup into a blender in three batches. Blend each batch until smooth and return to pot to keep warm. Serve garnished with sniped chives or mild green onion."
