        "In a large pot over medium heat, cook beef until no longer pink.  Drain and set aside.",
        "In the same pot, heat the olive oil.  Cook onion, celery, garlic and black pepper until vegetables are tender, 10 minutes.  Stir in beef broth, crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with thyme, basil, oregano and parsley.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer 1 hour.  (At this point, you may put the pot on a back burner to keep warm and continue with the next steps about 1 hour prior to serving, if you wish.)",
