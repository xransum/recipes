        "Toss 2 pounds raspberries and 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large heavy pot. Let sit until raspberries start to release their juices, 20\u201330 minutes.",
        "Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first and then more often as mixture thickens (as sugars concentrate, jam will be more likely to scorch), until most of the liquid evaporates and mixture is thickened, 30\u201340 minutes. To test for thickness, place a small dollop of jam on a chilled plate and chill 2 minutes. Drag your finger through: It should leave a clear path that doesn't fill in. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoons rose water. Divide between jars, cover, and chill.",
        "Jam can be made 2 months ahead. Keep chilled."
