        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture, just until incorporated. Pour half of batter into prepared pan. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle half of mixture over batter. Add remainder of batter and sprinkle with rest of topping. With the tip of a knife, swirl lightly through the batter.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely."
