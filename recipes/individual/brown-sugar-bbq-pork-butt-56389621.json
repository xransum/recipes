  "directions": [
    "Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Place pork in foil tray and rub all over with sugar mixture, then cover tray with foil and chill overnight.",
    "Prepare a grill for medium, indirect heat, preferably with hardwood or hardwood charcoal. Uncover pork, then place pork in tray over indirect heat and close grill. Grill pork, basting with any juices from pan every 30 minutes and adding coals or wood as needed, until pork is very tender, 4–5 hours; loosely tent pork with foil if it starts to become too dark. Let stand at least 15 minutes before shredding.",
    "Pork can be kept covered in the refrigerator after grilling for up to 5 days. When ready to serve, Preheat oven to 250°F. Place pork in a roasting pan with a few tablespoons of water. Cover with foil and rewarm pork until hot, 20–25 minutes."
