        "Sift flour, oat bran, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl; set aside. Beat eggs for 1 minute, then beat in yogurt, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is just blended. Fold apples, zucchini, and carrot into batter until evenly distributed. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling cups about 2/3 full.",
