Fold half of the egg whites into flour mixture, then gently fold in remaining egg whites.",

Bake, rotating pan halfway through and covering with foil during the last 15 minutes of baking, until golden brown, firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35\u201340 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool.",

        "Using a pastry brush, brush top of cooled cake with 2 Tbsp. vanilla syrup; reserve remaining syrup for another use. Spread frosting over top of cake, swirling decoratively. Top with raspberries and edible flowers, if using.",

Frosting can be made 3 days ahead; cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly on surface, and chill. Bring to room temperature before using."
