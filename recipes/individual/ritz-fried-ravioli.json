    "In a large frying pan, over medium heat, add the vegetable oil until it is about 2 inches deep. Heat to 325 degrees F.",
    "While the oil is heating, place the RITZ Crackers in a food processor and pulse until the crackers are crushed into fine crumbs.  Pour the crumbs into a shallow dish.  Add the garlic powder, pepper, Italian seasoning and 2 tablespoons of the parmesan cheese. Stir until all spices are evenly distributed.",
    "Whisk together the egg and milk in a bowl.",
    "Dip each ravioli in the egg mixture, then into the RITZ cracker crumbs.  Be sure each ravioli is evenly coated with cracker crumbs.  Shake off any excess.",
    "Once the oil is hot enough, add small batches of the RITZ cracker-coated ravioli into the oil. Fry for approximately 1 minute on each side.  Watch closely so they do not burn; they cook quickly.  When ravioli are golden brown on each side, remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
    "Sprinkle the ravioli with remaining grated parmesan cheese and (optional) chopped parsley. Serve with warm marinara sauce for dipping."
