        "Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the bacon is crispy, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Meanwhile, stir 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce in a sauce pan over medium heat. Simmer 5 minutes, whisking constantly. Pour the sauce over the cooked meatloaf, and let rest 5 minutes before serving."
