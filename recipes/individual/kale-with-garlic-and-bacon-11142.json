        "In a large heavy skillet cook the bacon over the moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it to paper towels to drain. In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the garlic, stirring, until it is golden, add the kale and the water, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes, or until the kale is wilted and tender. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, until most of the liquid is evaporated and stir in the bacon and salt and pepper to taste."
