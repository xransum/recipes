        "Heat the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the onion, and saut\u00e9 until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and broccoli to the skillet, and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and the broccoli has warmed through. In a medium bowl, stir together the cornbread mix, milk, cottage cheese, eggs, salt, and 1 cup of the cheddar cheese until smooth, then pour the batter into the skillet over the vegetables and stir to blend. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the remaining cheese. Bake the cornbread in the skillet for about 30 minutes, until it is lightly golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve."
