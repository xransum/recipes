        "Preheat a Breville pizza maker on the preheat setting for 30 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into small pieces with a spatula, until browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough into a 10-inch (25-cm) round. Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Transfer the dough to a floured pizza peel. Spread half of the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch (12-mm) border uncovered. Top the pizza with half each of the fennel, cheese and sausage.",
        "Transfer the pizza to the pizza maker. Bake on the classic setting according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the crust is crisp and the cheese is lightly browned, 10 to 11 minutes.",
        "Using the pizza peel, transfer the pizza to a cutting board and drizzle with the pizza oil. Preheat the pizza maker again, assemble the remaining pizza and bake on the classic setting. Cut the pizza into slices and serve immediately. Makes two 10-inch (25-cm) pizzas.",
