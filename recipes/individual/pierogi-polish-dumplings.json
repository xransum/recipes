        "To prepare the sauerkraut filling, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Stir in the onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the drained sauerkraut and cook for an additional 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.",

        "To make the dough, beat together the eggs and sour cream until smooth.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; stir into the sour cream mixture until dough comes together.  Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.  Divide the dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8 inch thickness.  Cut into 3 inch rounds using a biscuit cutter.",
        "Place a small spoonful of the mashed potato filling into the center of each round.  Moisten the edges with water, fold over, and press together with a fork to seal.  Repeat procedure with the remaining dough and the sauerkraut filling.",
        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add perogies and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until pierogi float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon."
