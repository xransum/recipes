(To do this, remove the burner on a gas stove and hold the pepper with tongs over the open flame until its skin blackens \u2014 and open your windows to let out the fumes. If you don't have a gas stove, fire up your broiler, cut the pepper in half, and place it skin-side up on a cookie sheet under the broiler. Once the skin is black, let it cool.) Set aside . . .",

        "6. Add spinach to the rice and fluff the rice, mixing the red pepper, rice, and spinach into an attractive pilaf . . . set aside . . . on a low burner if you'd like to keep it warm . . .keep an eye on it so it doesn't overcook or scorch . . .",

Add equal parts sugar and wasabi powder (around two or three tablespoons each . . . whatever your taste) to the coconut milk as you gradually increase heat to allow the sugar and wasabi to melt into the coconut milk . . . be careful not to scorch . . . set aside . . . over low heat to keep warm . . . careful not to let the sauce break up . . . not too much heat . . .",
        "9. Over high heat . . . in a cast-iron skillet . . . with a touch of olive oil if you like . . . pan-sear the tuna . . . rare . . . or to your liking . . .",
