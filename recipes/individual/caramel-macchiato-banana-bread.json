        "In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until almost smooth, and stir in the coffee creamer, vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, and instant coffee granules until the coffee granules have dissolved. Gradually stir in the flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter is almost smooth, and pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.",
