        "At least 1 and up to 8 hours before you plan to grill the pork chops, prepare the dry rub, combining the ingredients in a small bowl. Coat the chops with the spice mixture, place them in a large plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate.",
        "Fire up the grill, bringing the heat to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test).",
        "Remove the chops from the refrigerator and let them sit covered at room temperature for about 20 minutes.",
        "Spray the chops with oil and transfer them to the grill. Grill for 18 to 20 minutes total. Turn onto each side twice, rotating the chops a half turn each time to get criss-cross grill marks. The chops are done when just a hint of pink remains at the center. Serve hot."
