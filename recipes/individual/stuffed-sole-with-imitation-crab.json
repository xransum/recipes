Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a sole fillet onto your work surface, and place 1/4 of the crab mixture onto one end. Roll the sole over the filling, and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining fillets, and place into a close-fitting baking dish, side by side. Cover with aluminum foil",
