        "Cut through the meaty side of each short rib to the bone at 1/2-inch intervals, leaving the meat attached to the bone. In a bowl whisk together well the garlic, the soy sauce, the oil, the gingerroot, the sugar, the vinegar, the sesame seeds, and the pepper and coat each rib thoroughly with the marinade, transferring the ribs as they are coated to a large resealable plastic bag. Add the scallions and any remaining marinade to the bag, seal the bag, and let the mixture marinate, chilled, turning the bag occasionally, overnight.",
        "Grill the ribs, the marinade discarded, meaty side down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 8 minutes, turn them, and grill them for 6 minutes more for medium-rare meat. Grill the scallions, turning them occasionally, for 4 minutes, or until they are just browned."
