        "Cook and stir the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat, breaking the meat up into crumbles as it cooks, until the meat is well browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the fat from the beef in a colander. Return beef to skillet, and stir in sour cream, ketchup, salt, and garlic powder. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer while you make the pockets.",
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Unroll the biscuits on a floured work surface, and lightly roll each biscuit out to a square about 4 inches on a side. Arrange the squares on a baking sheet. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the beef mixture into the center of each square, and fold a corner over to meet its opposite corner, making a triangle. Seal the edges with a fork, and cut three small slits into the top of each pocket.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Brush each pocket with melted butter."
