        "Season the filets with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "In a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the olive oil until almost smoking. Working in batches if needed (do not overcrowd), cook the filets, turning once, until browned on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 130\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the filets to a warmed platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium and add the bacon to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.",
        "Warm the remaining 2 Tbs. oil in the pan, add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in the stock, Cabernet wine reduction, bacon, thyme and any accumulated meat juices. Simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Transfer the filets to individual plates and spoon the sauce over the meat, dividing evenly. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
