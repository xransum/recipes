        "In wide, shallow, covered pan, bring 1 inch water to boil. Set steamer basket in pan and carefully layer chard leaves inside. Steam until tender and flexible, about 5 minutes. Transfer chard to kitchen towel-lined plate to drain.",
        "Arrange 1 leaf on work surface, overlapping slit sides slightly. Spoon 1/2 cup filling onto center of leaf and fold in top and bottom of leaf to cover filling. Starting on one side, roll up leaf as for burrito. Place seam-side down on baking sheet in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling. Serve burritos warm."
