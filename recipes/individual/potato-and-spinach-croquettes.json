        "Place the potatoes into a saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork. Drain and toss gently over low heat for a minute to completley dry out. Press them through a sieve or just mash with a potato masher until smooth. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix in the butter and egg yolk, then spread out on a tray to cool.",
        "Preheat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). The oil is the proper temperature when a cube of bread browns in about 15 seconds.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese and spinach. Blend in the mashed potatoes. On a floured surface, using floured hands, roll small handfuls of the mixture into cylinders about 3/4 inch thick and 2 1/2 inches long. Tap the ends to flatten.",
        "Season 1/2 cup of flour with salt and pepper and place on a tray. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and peanut oil. Place the bread crumbs into a separate shallow bowl. Roll the croquettes in seasoned flour, then dip into the egg and then coat with bread crumbs.",
        "Fry the croquettes a few at a time, so they have some room in between, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Carefully remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on crumpled paper towels."
