Into a bowl sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt and stir into butter mixture until just combined well.",

Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack before cutting into 16 squares. Brownies keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at cool room temperature, 5 days."
