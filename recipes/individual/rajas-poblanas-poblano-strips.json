Remove peppers from griddle and place in a plastic bag, allowing them to sweat for 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel and discard the outer skin of the peppers; halve length-wise and remove the seeds and veins. Slice into thick strips. Set aside.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the corn into the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook another 5 minutes. Add the poblano strips to the saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the vegetables and bring to a simmer; cook at a simmer until hot, about 5 minutes more."
