        "In a heavy kettle cook the onion, the celery, the carrots, and the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, stir in the tomatoes, the clam juice, the water, and the red pepper flakes, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 3 minutes. In a heavy skillet brown the kielbasa in batches over moderate heat, transferring it as it is browned to paper towels to drain. To the tomato mixture add the clams and boil them, covered, for 3 to 6 minutes, transferring them as they are opened to a bowl. Discard any unopened clams and return the opened ones to the tomato mixture. Stir in the kielbasa, the parsley, and salt to taste and heat the soup until it is hot.",
        "Scrub the clams thoroughly with a stiff brush under cold water discarding any that have cracked shells or that are not shut tightly."
