        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Heat vegetable oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high. Cook steak until deep golden brown, 5\u20138 minutes per side. Add butter and spoon over steak a few times. Transfer skillet to oven and roast steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0F for rare, 5\u20138 minutes. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest. Increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0F.",

        "Meanwhile, cut half of the radishes into quarters (leave the tops on, if using); trim and thinly slice remaining radishes crosswise. Toss radishes, celery leaves, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining anchovy mixture in a medium bowl. Season radish salad with kosher salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.",
