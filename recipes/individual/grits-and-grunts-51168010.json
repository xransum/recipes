        "First, prepare the grits. Bring the water and salt to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Whisking the whole time, add the grits in a steady stream. Reduce the heat to low or medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until the grits have bloomed and are creamy. Stir in the butter and taste for salt. Keep warm.",
        "Fry the bacon in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, until crispy. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain. Add the onion to the pan and saut\u00e9 in the bacon fat until soft. Keep warm.",
        "Coat the fillets thoroughly with Cajun seasoning and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a large clean saut\u00e9 pan or in the bacon pan over medium-high heat. Add the fish fillets and fry for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until just cooked through. While the fish is cooking, crack the eggs into the pan and fry alongside the fish, or fry in a separate skillet if the pan is not large enough to accommodate both.",
        "Spoon the grits into two large shallow serving bowls and sprinkle with the bacon and saut\u00e9ed onion. Top each with 2 fish fillets and crown with an egg. Lay the sliced avocado and tomato on the side and season with salt and pepper."
