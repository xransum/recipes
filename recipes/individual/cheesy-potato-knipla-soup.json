        "Place the potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 3 quarts of water into a large pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat while you proceed to make the knipla.",
        "Combine 5 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl; pour in the eggs and 1 1/4 cups water.  Mix until the dough comes together, about two minutes.  Knead on a lightly floured surface for 3 to 5 minutes until elastic.  Using kitchen scissors, snip off pieces of the dough into the boiling soup.  Boil until the knipla rise to the surface, then reduce heat to low, and simmer while you make the cheese sauce.",

Pour in milk and add cheese; cook until the cheese melts and the mixture thickens, stirring constantly.  Pour the cheese sauce into the soup and simmer for 20 minutes more, or until ready to serve."
