Add wine and cook, scraping bottom of pan with a wooden spoon to release brown bits, then add 1 1/2 cups room-temperature water. Bring mixture to a simmer, continuing to scrape bottom of pan and adding water by the tablespoon if pan starts to dry out, and cook until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10\u201312 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed.",
