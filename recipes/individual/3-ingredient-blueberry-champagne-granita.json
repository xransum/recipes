  "directions": [
    "Bring sugar, 1 cup blueberries, and 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan; cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Transfer blueberry syrup to a medium bowl set inside an ice bath and let cool.",
    "Purée syrup and remaining blueberries in a food processor until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a 13x9\" (or other 3-qt.) freezer-safe baking dish, pressing on solids to extract as much juice as possible; discard solids.",
    "Pour sparkling wine into baking dish and stir to combine. Freeze mixture until just beginning to crystallize, about 2 hours. Scrape with a fork, then continue to freeze, scraping every hour, until texture is similar to shaved ice, 3–4 hours more. Cover with plastic wrap and keep frozen until ready to serve.",
    "Granita can be made 5 days ahead; keep frozen."
