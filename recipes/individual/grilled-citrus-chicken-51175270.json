        "Prepare grill for medium heat. Rub one 3 1/2- to 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces, with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill chicken, skin side down, turning occasionally and squeezing the juice from 2 lemon halves and 2 orange halves over often, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0F, 25-35 minutes. Meanwhile, brush another 2 lemon halves and 2 orange halves with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Grill, cut side down, until lightly charred, 5-10 minutes. Serve chicken with grilled lemon and orange halves alongside for squeezing over."
