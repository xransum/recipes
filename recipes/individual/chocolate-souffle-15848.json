        "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter and sugar a 6-cup souffl\u00e9 mold or charlotte.",
        "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. When the chocolate has melted, remove from heat. Whisk in the milk and 1/3 cup of sugar until the mixture is smooth; then whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Make sure no traces of yolk remain visible.",
        "Whip the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar with a whisk or an electric mixer at medium speed. When the whites are opaque and begining to stiffen, slowly add the 2 Tbsp. of sugar. If you are using a mixer, increase the speed to high. Beat until stiff.",
        "Stir 1/4 of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture, then gently fold the chocolate into the remaining whites.",
        "Pour the batter into the mold and place it on the middle rack of the oven. Immediately reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until a knife blade comes out clean. If you like your souffl\u00e9 creamy at the center, remove it from the oven sooner.",
        "Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately. Optional accompaniments are chocolate sauce and whipped cream."
