        "Heat a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add ham and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, adding vegetable oil as needed if the ham scraps are lean. Add shallots and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in coffee, scraping up any browned bits.",
        "Add stock, sorghum syrup, and vinegar; bring to a simmer and cook until sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Strain into a small bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool completely; cover and chill. Rewarm before using.",
        "Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add broth, peas, and 3 bay leaves. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, skimming the surface occasionally, until peas are tender, about 1 1/4 hours. Discard bay leaves.",

        "Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in small pan over medium heat. Simmer until browned bits form on bottom of pan, 5-6 minutes. Stir in coriander, fennel, lemon peel, cayenne, and remaining 2 bay leaves; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm and discard bay leaves and lemon peel from spice butter before serving.",

Roast pork, occasionally brushing with glaze, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into meat registers 140\u00b0F, about 15 minutes. Transfer meat to a carving board. Let rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.",
        "Reheat peas and spice butter. Cut pork into 1/4\"-1/2\"-thick slices. Transfer to plates and spoon pickle pur\u00e9e over. Serve with peas drizzled with spoonfuls of spice butter."
