        "1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush both halves with the butter and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Place them, cut sides down, on a baking sheet and roast until fork-tender, about 1 hour.",
        "2. Meanwhile, in a skillet, combine the broth, syrup, cider, soy sauce, lemon juice, and garlic. Boil for 5 minutes, then whisk in the cornstarch and cook, whisking constantly, until the glaze thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes more. Set aside.",
        "3. Slice the tofu into 1/2-inch-thick slabs. Then use a knife or a cookie cutter to create cubes or playful shapes. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes a side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.",
        "4. Scoop the squash strands out and into bowls. Top with the tofu, drizzle on the glaze, and serve."
