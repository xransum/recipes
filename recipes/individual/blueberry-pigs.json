    "Spread approximately 2 cups blueberries on each rolled pastry, or enough to make a single layer of blueberries leaving a 2 inch border. Sprinkle with cinnamon, sugar and slices of butter.",
    "Roll pastry like a jelly-roll, tucking the ends as you roll, and place on a cookie sheet.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until golden brown."
