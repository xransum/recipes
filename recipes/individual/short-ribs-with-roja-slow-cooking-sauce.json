        "If cooking the short ribs in an oven instead of in a slow cooker, preheat to 325\u00b0F. Generously season the short ribs with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the onions and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a slow cooker or Dutch oven.",
        "Return the fry pan to medium-high heat and warm the remaining 1 Tbs. oil. Working in batches, brown the short ribs, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the slow cooker or Dutch oven and add the slow cooking sauce. If using a slow cooker, cover and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. If using a Dutch oven, cover and cook in the oven for 2 hours.",
        "Transfer the short ribs and onions to a warmed platter. Skim the fat off the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper. Spoon the sauce over and around the ribs. Serve immediately with the green rice. Serves 6.",
