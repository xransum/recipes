    "Place the garlic on a cutting board and sprinkle with salt. Using the side of a chef’s knife, smash the garlic, then press and drag the side of the knife back and forth over the garlic to create a paste. Place in a bowl and whisk in the olive oil, pimentón and pepper. Add the shrimp and lemon slices and toss to coat evenly.",
    "Place 2 half-sheets of parchment paper, each 12 by 16 inches, on a work surface. Place half of the shrimp mixture in the center of each sheet.",
    "Bring the long ends of 1 parchment sheet together in the center and create a 1/2-inch fold. Make several more 1/2-inch folds to form a tight seal, then twist the ends of the packet to close completely. Place the packets on the baking tray of a Cuisinart steam oven.",
    "Position a rack in the lower rung of the steam oven. Transfer the tray to the oven. Turn the oven to the super-steam setting at 400ºF according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Steam until the shrimp are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer the packets to a platter and carefully open them. Serve the shrimp immediately. Serves 4.",
