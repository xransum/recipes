        "Cut the beef into strips that are approximately 1-inch wide and the same length or close to the length of the bacon strip, about 1/8-inch thick.",
        "Make the beef bacon rolls by laying a strip of bacon on a strip of beef and rolling the two meats together so that the beef is on the outside when you finish rolling. Insert a toothpick so that it goes in on the bottom left side and comes out the top right side when looked at vertically.",
        "In large skillet, saute onions in butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Lay a single layer of beef bacon rolls in the skillet. Brown them on medium heat, turning once or twice, about 5 minutes. Cover the skillet and simmer for about 2 hours."
