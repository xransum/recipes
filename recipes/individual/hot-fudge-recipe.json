        "What Makes This Recipe Sing: The versatility of this sauce makes it the WOW hostess gift. Try with grilled fruit, over sponge cakes or even as a \"no need for the fondue pot\" chocolate dunk for fresh fruits, cookies and pound cakes. This sauce is a classic and of course perfect for your favorite ice cream... My choice is peppermint ice cream. Also, it makes for easily made s'mores and if all else fails, just use a good old-fashioned spoon!",
        "BYOC: Try adding a swirl, by heating peanut butter and swirling in the fudge. Add your favorite toasted nuts, a drop of peppermint or orange oil, or even your favorite cereal for a crunchy fudge sauce."
