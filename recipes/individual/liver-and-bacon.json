        "Cook liver in bacon grease over medium high heat, turning occasionally to brown both sides. Depending on the size of your skillet you may need to work in batches and add more bacon grease. Liver is done when juices run clear. Return bacon to the skillet during the last 2 minutes of cooking to warm through. Serve hot with your favorite side dish."
