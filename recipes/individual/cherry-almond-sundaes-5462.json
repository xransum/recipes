    "Bring 1 pound cherries, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water and 6 tablespoons sugar to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until cherries are tender, about 12 minutes. Mix cornstarch, lemon juice and 1¤ tablespoons water in small bowl until cornstarch dissolves; mix into sauce. Stir until sauce boils and thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; mix in almond extract. If sauce is too thick, thin with more water by teaspoonfuls. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)",
    "Halve remaining cherries; combine with remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl. Let stand until juices form, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.",
    "Divide halved cherries and juices among 6 bowls. In each, place 2 scoops of ice cream, cherry sauce and almonds."
