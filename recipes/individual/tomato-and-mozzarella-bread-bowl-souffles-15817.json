        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",
        "In a small bowl cover dried tomatoes with boiling water by 1 inch. Soak dried tomatoes 30 minutes. Drain tomatoes in a sieve and pat very dry.",
        "Quarter and seed plum tomatoes. Cut tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice and drain on paper towels. Pat tomatoes dry. Cut mozzarella into 1/4-inch dice.",
        "Cut off and discard top thirds of rolls. Hollow out centers of rolls, leaving a 1/3-inch-thick shell. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and brush insides of shells. Season shells with salt and pepper and arrange on a baking sheet.",
        "In a saucepan melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over moderately low heat and whisk in flour. Cook roux, stirring, 3 minutes and whisk in milk and cream. Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes. In a food processor pur\u00e9e together milk mixture, dried tomatoes, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth.",
        "Separate eggs. Transfer pur\u00e9e to a large bowl and stir in yolks, plum tomatoes, and mozzarella. Cool mixture completely. Bread shells, egg whites, and tomato mixture may be chilled, covered, up to 6 hours.",
