        "Add tomatoes to pot. Continue to simmer soup until beef is very tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Adjust seasoning, adding more soy sauce by tablespoonfuls and more salt, if desired. Season with pepper.",
        "Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain well.",
        "Divide noodles among large soup bowls. Add some bok choy to each, if desired. Ladle soup and meat over. Garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro. Serve with Pickled Mustard Greens .",
        "Chili bean paste is a spicy, fermented soybean paste. **Star anise\u2014**a star-shaped seedpod\u2014is available at some supermarkets. Chinese yellow rock sugar is made from raw sugar; it is often used in Chinese sauces and teas. Despite their name, Sichuan peppercorns aren't related to regular peppercorns; the mildly hot dried berries, which resemble split peppercorns, come from the prickly ash tree. Shandong la mian are Chinese wheat noodles. Look for these ingredients at specialty foods stores and Asian markets."
