        "In a large pot over medium heat, combine the butter or margarine and the onions. Saute for about 3 minutes. Add flour and stir well until mixed. Add broth, raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Whisk mixture to keep flour from clumping.",
        "Add milk, reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the blue cheese and stir until blended, then add the spinach and cook 3 more minutes. Add the cream, bring just to a boil, turn off heat and stir well. Add salt and cayenne pepper to taste.",
        "Allow to cool and puree in a food processor or blender a little at a time. Ladle into individual bowls and sprinkle with the bacon. (Note: to serve cold, omit the bacon and add a little freshly squeezed lemon juice.)"
