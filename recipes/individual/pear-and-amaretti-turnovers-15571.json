Roll out second pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to 14 1/2-inch square. Using 4 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch parchment template, cut out 6 pear shapes from pastry. Brush edges of pastries on baking sheet with water. Arrange larger pear-shaped pastries atop pears, pressing pastry edges together to adhere. Press edges with fork to seal. Using skewer, poke small hole in top of each turnover to allow steam to escape. Press 1 almond sliver in tip of each turnover to represent stem. Cover and refrigerate 20 minutes.",
