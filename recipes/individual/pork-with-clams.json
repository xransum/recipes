        "Put pork in a dish, and add the wine, paprika, bay leaf, cloves, pepper, salt and 2 cloves of garlic. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally.",
        "In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons margarine. Saute onions, tomatoes and 5 cloves of garlic. Cook gently until onions are soft; add salt and pepper to taste.",
        "Wash the clams, discarding any that are open.  Add them to the onion/tomato mixture. Cover, and cook over high heat until all clams have opened, about 5 minutes, then cook for another minute.",
        "Meanwhile, drain the pork; set marinade aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons margarine in a large frying pan over medium heat. Cook pork until brown on all sides.  Stir in marinade, and cook until there is very little liquid left. Keep turning pork or it will stick and burn!",
        "Serve the pork, the clams in their shells, and the onion mixture with boiled potatoes. Sprinkle everything with coriander and parsley, and garnish with lemon quarters."
