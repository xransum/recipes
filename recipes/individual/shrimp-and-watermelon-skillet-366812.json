Cook shrimp and shallots, stirring, until shrimp is pink and shallots are crisp, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to a bowl. In same skillet, cook watermelon and 1/4 cup water over high heat, stirring, until liquid becomes syrupy, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; add shrimp mixture, salt and pepper; stir. Divide shrimp-watermelon mixture (warm or chilled) among 4 plates; add cucumber and feta. Sprinkle with dill and mint. Serve with 4 pita pieces each and lime wedges."
