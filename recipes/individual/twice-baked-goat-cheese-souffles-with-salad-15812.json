        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F and butter six 3/4-cup ramekins (3 3/4 by 2 inches). Crumble goat cheese and separate eggs. In a saucepan melt butter over moderately low heat and whisk in flour. Cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes and whisk in milk. Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and add yolks, mustard, 1 teaspoon thyme, two thirds cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, whisking until cheese is melted. Transfer yolk mixture to a large bowl.",
        "In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir one fourth whites into yolk mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites and remaining cheese gently but thoroughly.",
        "Divide souffl\u00e9 mixture among ramekins and arrange in a large baking pan just large enough to hold them. Add enough hot water to baking pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake souffl\u00e9s in middle of oven until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes, and transfer to a rack. Let souffl\u00e9s stand, uncovered, 30 minutes (souffl\u00e9s will fall slightly).",
        "Lightly butter a baking sheet. Run a thin knife around edges of souffl\u00e9s. Invert each souffl\u00e9 onto palm of your hand and carefully put, right side up, onto baking sheet. Souffl\u00e9s may be made up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.",
        "Increase temperature to 425\u00b0F.",
        "In a small saucepan bring cream with remaining teaspoon thyme and salt and pepper to taste to a boil. Remove pan from heat and keep cream warm, covered. Bake souffl\u00e9s in middle of oven until slightly puffed and heated through, about 5 minutes.",
        "Transfer souffl\u00e9s to plates. Spoon 2 tablespoons cream over each souffl\u00e9 and arrange salad decoratively alongside."
