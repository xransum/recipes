  "directions": [
    "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Line baking sheet with foil. Pierce potatoes in several places with fork; place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until potatoes are tender when pierced with fork, about 55 minutes. Cool slightly.",
    "Meanwhile, place cranberries in small bowl; pour enough hot water over to cover. Let stand 5 minutes to soften. Drain well. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pears and sauté until tender and golden, about 4 minutes. Stir in cranberries, pecans, ginger, and brown sugar; sauté 1 minute. Mix in 2 teaspoons vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt.",
    "Cut off top 1/4 of each potato lengthwise; discard tops. Using fork, gently mash pulp inside each potato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over low heat. Whisk in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon butter-vinegar mixture into each potato; mix with fork to blend.",
    "Mound cranberry mixture in sweet potatoes. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature. Rewarm sweet potatoes uncovered in 350°F oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.)"
