        "In a bowl whisk together the cornmeal, the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt. In a food processor pur\u00e9e coarse the corn. In another bowl whisk together the corn pur\u00e9e, the eggs, the milk, and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter, add the egg mixture to the cornmeal mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Let the batter stand, covered, for 10 minutes and stir in the bacon, crumbled.",
        "Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot and brush it lightly with some of the additional melted butter. Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/4-cup measures and cook the pancakes for 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are cooked to a heated platter and brushing the griddle with some of the additional melted butter as necessary. Serve the pancakes with the syrup."
