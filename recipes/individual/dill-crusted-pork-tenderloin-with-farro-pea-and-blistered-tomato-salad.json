        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Mix garlic, 2 Tbsp. dill, 1 Tbsp. lemon zest, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, and pepper in a small bowl with a fork to create a paste. Pat pork tenderloin dry and rub with paste.",
        "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Sear pork, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 10\u201312 minutes. Add tomatoes, then transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of pork registers 145\u00b0F and tomatoes are lightly blistered and softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes before slicing.",
        "Meanwhile, whisk remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. kosher salt in a medium bowl. Add arugula, farro, peas, feta, and remaining 3 Tbsp. dill and 1 Tbsp. lemon zest; toss well to combine (arugula will wilt slightly when dressed). Gently fold in roasted tomatoes.",
        "Slice pork and transfer to a platter; season with sea salt, if using. Serve with farro salad alongside.",
        "Pork can be marinated 4 hours ahead; keep chilled. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before cooking."
