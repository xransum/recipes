        "Line a large baking sheet with heavy foil; set aside. Place Ghirardelli(R) Dark Melting Wafers in a microwave-safe container. Microwave at half power or defrost setting for 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly (product keeps its original shape until stirred). If not completely melted, continue to microwave at 15 second intervals and stir until smooth. Overheating will cause wafers to burn. Spread melted wafers on prepared baking sheet in a 10x8-inch rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.",
        "Immediately sprinkle with desired sweet and salty toppings; press toppings lightly into bark. Chill for 30 minutes or until firm. Carefully break candy into pieces."
