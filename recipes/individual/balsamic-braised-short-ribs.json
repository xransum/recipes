        "Preheat an oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Season the short ribs generously with salt and pepper.",
        "In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, sear the ribs until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. As each batch is done, transfer the ribs to a platter.",
        "Add the shallots to the pot and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and red wine to the pot and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the pan bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar and stock and bring to a boil. Return the ribs to the pot.",
        "Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is fork tender, about 2 hours. To serve, using a slotted spoon, divide the ribs among individual shallow bowls. Skim the fat off the sauce. Spoon some of the sauce over the ribs and serve. Serves 2.",
