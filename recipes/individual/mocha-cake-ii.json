        "Prepare vanilla pudding with 3 cups of the milk as package directs, reserving remainder of milk for chocolate pudding. When vanilla pudding is done and still hot, pour over toasts.  Let cool slightly, then put the another layer of toasts on top of the vanilla pudding.",
        "Pour the remaining liqueur mixture over toasts until they absorb all of it. Prepare the chocolate pudding as you did the vanilla and again while hot, pour over toasts. Let cool, then refrigerate overnight. Next day unmold from spring form pan, top with non-dairy topping and almonds."
