Add the oats one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the dried tart cherries and mix just until they are distributed evenly.",
        "Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of batter about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Do not shape them, they will spread evenly during the baking process. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 13 minutes. The tops of the cookies should just turn a light golden brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and let sit on the sheets for about 5 minutes before moving the cookies to cooling racks. Let cookies cool to room temperature than place in airtight containers for storage."
