        "Mix all the rub ingredients together and set aside.",
        "Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and allow them to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a grill to high, placing the majority of the coals and a couple (optional) fist-sized wood chunks in the center of the grill to create a cool zone on the outer edges.",
        "Once the steaks have come to room temperature, coat all sides with the olive oil; then season generously with the coffee-coriander rub. Place the steaks in the center of the grill, cover, and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and grill, covered, for another 3 minutes. Flip and cook each side for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until they reach your desired level of doneness (145\u00b0 to 150\u00b0F for medium-rare and 150\u00b0 to 160\u00b0F for medium according to the USDA. Remember, however, that the meat will rise in temperature as much as 10 degrees as it rests). Remove from the grill and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes so that the juices have time to redistribute and don't end up all over your serving platter or cutting board."
