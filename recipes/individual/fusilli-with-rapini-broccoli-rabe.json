        "Fill a saucepan with enough water to cover the broccoli rabe, sprinkle in some salt, and bring the salted water to a boil. Stir in the broccoli rabe, and cook until bright green and just starting to become tender, about 2 minutes; drain the rabe, and cool in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain well, and pat dry with paper towels.",
        "Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.",
        "While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the 2 roughly-chopped garlic cloves until they start to turn translucent, about 2 minutes; sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and stir in rosemary sprig, dried Italian herb mix, and crushed red pepper flakes.",
        "Stir in the blanched rabe, white wine, and tomatoes; remove rosemary sprig, and bring the mixture to a boil. Mix in the cooked fusilli pasta, green onions, and 1 minced clove of garlic; simmer for 1 more minute, and serve topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese."
