        "In a small bowl, combine the raisins and bourbon. Set aside.",
        "Combine the rice and salt with 1 1/2 cups water in a medium heavy-bottomed stainless steel saucepan. Bring it to a boil, stir once, and simmer, covered, on the lowest heat for 8 to 9 minutes, until most of the water is absorbed. (If your stove is very hot, pull the pan halfway off the burner.)",
        "Stir in 4 cups of half-and-half and the sugar and bring to a boil. Simmer uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, until the rice is very soft and the pudding is thick. Stir often, particularly toward the end. Slowly stir in the beaten egg and continue to cook for 1 minute. Off the heat, add the remaining cup of half-and-half, the vanilla, maple syrup, maple flavoring, and the raisins with any remaining bourbon. Stir well. Pour into a bowl, and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Cool slightly, add the pecans, and serve warm or chilled. Drizzle each serving with extra maple syrup, if desired."
