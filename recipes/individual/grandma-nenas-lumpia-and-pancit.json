        "Bring 2 quarts of water of  water to a boil in a saucepan. Add chicken, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until done. Reserve chicken stock, and allow chicken to cool. Cut chicken into small cubes.",
        "In a large skillet or wok, saute pork until evenly brown. Stir in chicken, cabbage, and carrots. Cook over medium heat until cabbage is tender. Remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly while you separate the wrappers.",
        "In small bowl, combine enough flour and water to make a paste about the consistency of glue. Spoon meat mixture into a thin line on each wrapper, and roll up, using a dab of the flour paste to seal the edge. Keep each lumpia thin; if you over fill them, the wrapper will tear. Save about 1/2 to 1/4 of the filling in the pot for the pancit.",
        "Heat large skillet with 1/2 to 1 inch of oil. Fry the lumpia one side at a time, until a nice golden brown. Drain, standing each piece upright, in a pot or bowl lined with paper towel.",
        "Return the remainder of the filling to the stove, and gently mix in the pancit noodles. Gradually add the chicken stock, and cook until noodles are tender.",
        "For the sauce:  With a mortar and pestle or back of a spoon, crush the garlic, then mix into the vinegar. Serve in small bowls with spoons. The sauce can be used as a dip, or to spoon into the lumpia."
