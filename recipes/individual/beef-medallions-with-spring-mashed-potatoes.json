        "Put the potatoes in a large pot. Add water to cover by 2 inches and then add the 1 tsp. salt. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick fry pan over medium heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the cabbage and season with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 until almost tender, about 8 minutes. Set aside.",
        "Reserve 1 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain the potatoes. Return the potatoes to the pot and mash coarsely with a fork, thinning with the cooking liquid as needed. Mix in 1 Tbs. butter, the cabbage and a generous amount of pepper. Adjust the seasonings if needed. Cover to keep warm.",
        "Cut the beef across the grain into 1/4-inch slices and then cut into 2-inch lengths. In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Working in batches, add the beef in a single layer and cook until just colored, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a plate and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Add the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil to the fry pan. Add the shallots, reduce the heat to medium, and stir until tender and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add the flour and stir for 20 seconds. Gradually stir in the broth and vermouth. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes. Stir in the mustard and the 1 1/2 Tbs. thyme. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 Tbs. butter until melted. Adjust the seasonings if needed.",
        "Transfer the beef and potatoes to a platter or divide among 4 warmed plates. Drizzle the sauce over the beef, sprinkle with thyme and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
