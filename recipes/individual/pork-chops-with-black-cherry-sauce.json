        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, then brown in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the pork chops to the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the pork chops are no longer pink in the center, and register 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, about 20 minutes.",
        "While the pork chops are baking, melt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat, and stir in the shallot and cherries. Cook until the shallot has begun to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the red wine and beef broth, and bring to a simmer. Season with rosemary, and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper before pouring over the pork chops to serve."
