        "Stack three 24x12\" sheets of parchment paper on another baking sheet. (Don't use foil-the tomato acid will react with aluminum.) Spoon tomato mixture onto one side of stacked parchment. Fold parchment layers over mixture and crimp edges tightly to form a sealed packet.",
        "Place baking sheet with tomato packet on upper rack and sheet with polenta on lower rack. Bake, turning polenta rounds once, until polenta is light golden and tomatoes are saucy (carefully open packet to check; steam will escape), 25-30 minutes. (You can also cook polenta in a grill pan or on a charcoal or gas grill.)",
