        "Combine the coconut milk, water, and cannellini beans in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir the basil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, mustard powder, coriander, smoked paprika, ground ginger, cardamom, turmeric, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick into the bean mixture.

Garnish with the parsley, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, and sprinkle with goat cheese to serve."
