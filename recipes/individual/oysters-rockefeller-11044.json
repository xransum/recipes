        "In a bowl combine the lettuce, the spinach, the scallion, 1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs, the minced parsley, the celery, and the garlic. In a skillet melt the butter over moderate heat and in it cook the vegetable mixture, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the greens are wilted. Stir in the liqueur, the anchovy paste, the cayenne, and salt and black pepper to taste and chill the mixture, covered, for 1 hour, or until it is cold.",
        "In another skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels to drain, and crumble it. Arrange 1 oyster in each of reserved shells and moisten the oysters with some of the reserved liquor. Spread half of the vegetable mixture by heaping teaspoons onto the oysters and sprinkle the bacon over it. Top the bacon with the remaining vegetable mixture and sprinkle each oyster with 1 tablespoon of the remaining 2 1/4 cups bread crumbs.",
        "Arrange the oysters on ovenproof platters or in jelly-roll pans filled with the coarse salt and bake them in the middle of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 18 minutes, or until the edges of the oysters begin to curl and the bread crumbs are browned well. Garnish the platters with the parsley sprigs and the lemon wedges."
