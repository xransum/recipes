        "Preheat an oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter a 6-cup souffl\u00e9 dish or gratin dish and dust with a few tablespoons of the Parmigiano-Reggiano.",
        "In a small saucepan, combine the garlic, cream and thyme. Cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Set aside.",
        "Place the spinach in a fry pan over medium-high heat, with water clinging to the leaves. Stir until wilted, 1 minute. Transfer the spinach to a colander and press out the moisture with the back of a large spoon. Chop finely.",
        "In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and continue whisking until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the 1 tsp. salt. Stir in the goat cheese and the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano. Stir in the egg yolks, spinach and garlic mixture. Season with white pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
        "In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Pour the souffl\u00e9 base on top and fold together until just blended. Scrape the mixture into the prepared dish, filling it no more than seven-eighths full. Bake until the souffl\u00e9 is golden brown and set, 30 minutes for a souffl\u00e9 dish, 25 minutes for a gratin dish. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
