Remove from oven and allow to cool until you can handle them. Remove the skins by placing the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel, folding it over, and rubbing until the skins come off. Discard the loosened skins, and chop the nuts into very small pieces by hand.",

Whisk in pepper, 2 tablespoons lemon zest, and shallots; slowly pour in canola oil while whisking vigorously until completely incorporated.
