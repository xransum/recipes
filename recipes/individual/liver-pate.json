        "Place cooked livers in a blender or food processor, and process until smooth.  Add chopped onion, sherry, butter or margarine, salt, black pepper, and mace; pulse to blend.  With hands lightly greased, form pate mixture into a mound, and place on a serving platter. Chill for 1 hour before serving."
