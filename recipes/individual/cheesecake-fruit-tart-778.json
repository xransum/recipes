        "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Unfold crust on work surface. Press out fold lines; if crust cracks, press together to seal. Rub crust with flour. Arrange crust, floured side down, in 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Fold excess pastry in, forming double-thick sides. Bake until brown, about 15 minutes (crust may crack in places). Cool.",
        "Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, 2 tablespoons amaretto, and almond and vanilla extracts in large bowl until blended and smooth. Spread cheese mixture in prepared crust. Refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)",
        "Mound blueberries in center of tart. Arrange nectarine slices in ring around berries. Place raspberries at outside edge. Stir apricot preserves in small saucepan over low heat until melted. Mix in remaining 1 tablespoon amaretto. Brush glaze over fruit topping. Refrigerate up to 2 hours."
