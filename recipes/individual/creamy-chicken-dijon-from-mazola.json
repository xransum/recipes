        "Pat chicken breasts dry with paper towels; cut each breast into 2 to 3 pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place half of the chicken in Dutch oven and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side or until nicely browned.",
        "Remove chicken to platter and repeat with remaining chicken. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add leeks and garlic and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until softened. Stir in chicken broth; bring to a boil stirring well to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Add chicken back to the Dutch oven; cover and simmer 10 minutes. Mix half and half and corn starch together; add to Dutch oven along with Dijon mustard and thyme. Stir until thickened. Remove from heat and let sit 3 minutes. Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with chopped, fresh parsley. Serve immediately with rice or noodles."
