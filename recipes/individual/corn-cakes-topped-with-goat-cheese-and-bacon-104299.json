Add 1 tablespoon oil to drippings in skillet. Add corn and onion; saut\u00e9 over medium heat until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Combine buttermilk, egg and 1/4 cup goat cheese in large bowl; whisk to blend. Add cornmeal, baking powder, salt, baking soda and cayenne and mix well. Stir in corn mixture. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, drop batter by generous tablespoonfuls into skillet. Cook until bottom of each corn cake is brown, about 1 minute. Turn corn cakes and cook until second side is brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to skillet as needed. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let corn cakes and bacon stand at room temperature. Before serving, rewarm cakes on baking sheet in 400\u00b0F oven until heated through, about 5 minutes.)",
