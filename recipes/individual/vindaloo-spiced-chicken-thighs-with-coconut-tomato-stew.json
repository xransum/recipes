        "Place the chicken thighs in a bowl and season with the 1 tsp. curry vindaloo and the 1 tsp. salt. Fold each thigh in half and skewer 4 thighs onto each of two 10-inch bamboo skewers; make sure the folded sides are uniform and face the same direction.",

        "Add the potatoes to the multicooker and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, the 2 Tbs. curry vindaloo and the onion mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to caramelize slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar, honey, lime juice, cinnamon stick, coconut milk and the 1 Tbs. salt.",
        "Place the chicken skewers lengthwise in the multicooker. Cover and set the multicooker on the slow-cook high setting for 1 hour. Using tongs, remove the chicken skewers from the multicooker and place 2 thighs on each of 4 plates. Spoon the sauce and potatoes on and around the chicken and serve immediately with steamed rice. Garnish with cilantro leaves. Serves 4.",
