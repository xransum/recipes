    "Push the onion and pepper mixture to the edges of the pan, and add the mango and pineapple to the center of the pan. Cook, without stirring, until the fruit begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Pour the lemon juice into the pan, and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
