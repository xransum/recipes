Spoon the filling into the shell and chill the pie for 1 hour. In a bowl beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they hold soft peaks, add the sugar, beating, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat the meringue until it holds stiff peaks. Spread the meringue over the filling and bake the pie in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes, or until the meringue is just golden. Chill the pie for 2 hours."
