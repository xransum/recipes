        "Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add water, dill weed, poultry seasoning, parsley, ground black pepper, chicken bouillon, and rice; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed and rice is just slightly undercooked, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir, taste, and adjust seasonings if desired. Cool completely before using to stuff a chicken."
