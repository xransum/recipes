        "In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, vinegar, tomatoes and broth. Set aside.",
        "Season the brisket generously with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the brisket, fat side down, and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Pour off all but 2 Tbs. of the fat from the pot. Add the onions and saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Stir in the allspice. Sprinkle the flour over the onion mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until blended, about 3 minutes. Pour in the reserved broth mixture and stir to combine. Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Preheat an oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Return the brisket to the pot, cover and cook in the oven until the brisket is very tender, 3 to 4 hours. Skim the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid.",
        "Let the brisket cool in the cooking liquid then transfer the brisket to a cutting board and slice the brisket across the grain. Warm the cooking liquid over medium heat. Arrange the slices on a platter, top with the warm cooking liquid and onions and serve. Serves 6 to 8.",
