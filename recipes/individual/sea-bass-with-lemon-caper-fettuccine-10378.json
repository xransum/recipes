In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the fettuccine until it is al dente, drain it well, and in the large bowl toss it with the lemon mixture and salt to taste until the mixture is combined well.",
        "Pat the fillets dry and season them with salt and pepper. In a non-stick skillet heat the vegetable oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saut\u00e9 the fillets, skin sides up, for 4 minutes. Turn the fillets and saut\u00e9 them for 4 minutes more, or until they are crisp and just flake. Divide the fettuccine between 2 heated plates, top it with the fillets, and drizzle each fillet with half of the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon mixture."
