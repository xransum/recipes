        "In a large bowl or baking dish, whisk together the oil, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the halibut and stir to coat it in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, in the refrigerator, 20 to 30 minutes.",
        "In a blender or food processor, blend together the peas, spinach, and lemon juice, stopping and scraping down the sides occasionally, and blending until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.",
        "Fill a large bowl with ice water.",
        "In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and boil, uncovered, until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, then immediately plunge the spears into the ice water to stop cooking. Drain the asparagus again and pat dry.",
        "In a medium saucepan saut\u00e9 pan over moderately high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the asparagus and toss it in the melted butter. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.",
        "In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, warm the chicken stock. Keep the stock hot on the stove.",
        "In a second medium saucepan over moderate heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shallot and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add the rice and saut\u00e9, stirring constantly, until just toasted. Add 1 cup of hot stock and simmer, stirring frequently, until the stock is almost absorbed, about 4 minutes. Add more stock, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next and stirring often, until the rice is tender and the mixture creamy, about 20 minutes longer. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter, Parmesan cheese, chives, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Remove the halibut from the marinade and pat dry, then roll each fillet in a piece of caul fat. In a large saut\u00e9 pan over moderate heat, warm the olive oil. Sear the halibut on all sides, then finish in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Divide the risotto among 4 plates. Top with asparagus and halibut, and drizzle with pea pur\u00e9e."

        "*Caul fat is a weblike membrane of fatty material that encases the organs of some animals, including pigs, sheep, and cows. When wrapped around meat or fish, it adds flavor, moisture, and fat, and basically melts into the meat or fish as it cooks. Some butchers and specialty markets carry caul fat, but you may need to ask your butcher or supermarket meat counter to order it. If you can't find caul fat, try wrapping the halibut in thin strips of bacon."
