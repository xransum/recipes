Reserving the drippings, remove the bacon, and blot off excess grease with paper towels; crumble and set aside. Add the olive oil, bay leaves, and red pepper flakes to the bacon drippings in the skillet and reheat. Cook the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow onion, green onion, and garlic in the olive oil mixture until tender.",

        "While the butter melts into the bean mixture, return the skillet to the heat and cook the sausage in the skillet until lightly browned; add the sausage to the beans. Rinse the bottom of the skillet with a small amount of water and pour into the bean mixture. Cook the beans another 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
