        "Toss to combine. Center beets on the sheet of foil. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Roast beets until cooked through, 35-45 minutes.",
        "Remove from oven. Open packets carefully by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then open top of foil packet. Let beets rest until they are cool enough to touch. Then peel and chop them into 1/3-inch pieces. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil, red wine vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.",
