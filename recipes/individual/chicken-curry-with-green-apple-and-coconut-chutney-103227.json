        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Pierce the \"eyes\" of the coconut with ice pick. Drain off liquid. Bake coconut until shell begins to crack, about 30 minutes. Tap coconut shell all over with hammer to remove shell. (The white meat with its brown skin should fall away from shell; if it doesn't, use paring knife to release meat.) Using paring knife, cut away brown skin, if desired. Rinse coconut. Coarsely chop enough coconut in processor to measure 3/4 cup (reserve remaining coconut for another use.)",
        "Heat small skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes (do not burn). Transfer seeds to plate; cool. Finely grind seeds in spice grinder or in mortar with pestle.",
        "Core apples; cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place apples in medium bowl. Add lemon juice and toss to coat. Combine 3/4 cup coconut, cumin, apples and all remaining ingredients in processor. Chop finely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.",
        "With processor running, drop garlic, chilies and ginger down feed tube and process until minced. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions; saut\u00e9 until brown, adding 2 tablespoons water during last minutes of cooking to prevent burning, about 10 minutes. Add chili mixture and 1 tablespoon water; saut\u00e9 3 minutes. Add cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and peppercorns; stir 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons water, bay leaves, coriander, cumin, cayenne and turmeric; saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add tomatoes and salt; cook until almost all the liquid evaporates, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces 1 at a time, turning to coat in tomato mixture. Add 1 cup water. Cover; simmer until chicken is cooked through, turning once, about 40 minutes.",
        "Spoon rice onto plates. Top with chicken and sauce. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with chutney."
