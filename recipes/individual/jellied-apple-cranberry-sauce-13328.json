    "directions": [
        "In a large saucepan combine the cranberries, the apples, chopped coarse (not peeled or cored), the wine, and the sugar, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until it is very thick and is reduced to about 3 cups. Force the mixture through a food mill fitted with the fine disk into a bowl, spoon it into an oiled 3-to-4 cup decorative mold, and chill it, covered, overnight. Run a thin knife around the edge of the mold and dip the mold into warm water for 10 seconds. Invert the mold onto a serving plate and garnish the cranberry sauce with the mint sprigs."
