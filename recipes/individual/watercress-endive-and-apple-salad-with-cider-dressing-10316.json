        "In a bowl whisk together the cider, the vinegar, the lemon juice, the mustard, the shallot, the Worcestershire sauce, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Let the dressing stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to let the flavors develop. In another bowl toss the apples, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. In a large bowl toss together the endive slices and the watercress with the remaining dressing and divide the watercress mixture among the 6 salad plates. Top the watercress with the apples and the almonds and garnish the plates with the reserved endive tips."
