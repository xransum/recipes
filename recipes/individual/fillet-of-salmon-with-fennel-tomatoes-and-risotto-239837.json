        "Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper. Add salmon to skillet and cook until brown on both sides but still medium-rare in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm. Add red onion and garlic to same skillet and cook until translucent, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine. Bring to boil, then add fennel and tomatoes.
