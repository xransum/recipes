        "Cut off 1 1/2 inches from bottom of eggplant and discard. Move knife 1/4 inch from cut side and cut almost but not all the way through eggplant (this is the pocket). Move knife 1/4 inch from pocket cut and cut slice free from eggplant. Make 7 more slices with pockets in same manner.",
        "Stir together pork, scallion, ginger, soy sauce, and salt in a bowl with a fork. Spread 1 tablespoon filling in each eggplant pocket.",
        "Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until it registers 360\u00b0F on thermometer (see cooks' note, below).",
        "Meanwhile, whisk together flour, egg, and water in a bowl until batter is smooth. Dip 4 eggplant slices, 1 at a time, into batter, shaking off excess to leave a thin coating, and fry, turning over once, until eggplant is tender when pierced with a fork and batter is pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 360\u00b0F, then coat and fry remaining 4 slices in same manner. Drain briefly on paper towels and serve immediately."
