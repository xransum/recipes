        "Beat 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Spread into prepared pan.",
