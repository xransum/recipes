        "Whisk together flour, pepper, salt, and dried herbs. Dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Heat 1/2 inch oil in an ovenproof 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably seasoned cast iron) until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360\u00b0F, then fry chicken in 2 batches, turning, until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer chicken as fried with tongs to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Cut potatoes lengthwise into eighths while chicken is cooking.",
        "Return oil to 360\u00b0F and cook potatoes in 3 batches, turning, until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer potatoes as cooked with tongs to paper towels to drain, then season with salt and pepper. Cool oil in skillet 15 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Pour off all but 1/4 inch oil from skillet, then carefully add wine down side.

Bake, uncovered, until potatoes are tender and chicken is tender and somewhat crisp, about 25 minutes.",
