        "To make the coleslaw, place the cabbage in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 6 to 8 pulses. Transfer to a large colander, sprinkle with salt and toss to combine. Let stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse the cabbage well with cold water and spin in a salad spinner to remove the excess moisture. Transfer to a large bowl, add the carrot and onion and toss to combine.",
        "In a bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, buttermilk, sour cream, vinegar, sugar and parsley until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the coleslaw and toss well to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.",

        "Divide the burger blend into 8 portions, each 3 oz., and roll each into a ball. Using a stuffed hamburger press according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, make 4 burgers, stuffing each with 1 slice of cheese. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Place the burgers on the grill and cook, turning once, for about 4 minutes per side for medium, or until done to your liking.",
