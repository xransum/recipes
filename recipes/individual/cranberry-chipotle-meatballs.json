        "Place the meatballs into a slow cooker. In a bowl, mash the cranberry sauce roughly, and mix with the pineapple chunks, brown sugar, and chipotle chile. Pour the sauce over the meatballs, and stir to combine. Cover the cooker, set to Low setting, and cook until the sauce is thickened and the meatballs have absorbed the sauce flavors, 4 to 5 hours. Serve with toothpicks."
