        "Meanwhile, cut bottom 2 inches from each lemongrass stalk (discard upper portions). Slice lemongrass into thin rounds; place in blender. Add 1/2 cup tamari, sugar, Sherry, peanut sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger; blend until almost smooth. Blend in coconut milk and remaining 6 tablespoons tamari for marinade.",

Brush sauce generously over ribs. Serve with Sesame-Cilantro Rice , passing remaining sauce alongside."
