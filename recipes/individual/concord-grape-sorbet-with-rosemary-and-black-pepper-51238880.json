        "Toss grapes into a food processor and process for 45-60 seconds, until they form 3-4 cups of a lumpy, vibrantly purple slurry. If your food processor is small, work in batches.",
        "Transfer pur\u00e9e to a saucepan; add honey, rosemary, and black peppercorns. Simmer mixture over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes, until slightly thickened and deeply fragrant.",
        "Set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour pur\u00e9e into sieve, straining out grape seeds, rosemary, and peppercorns. Cover bowl and transfer it to the refrigerator. Allow pur\u00e9e to chill for at least 12 hours.",
        "Churn pur\u00e9e in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spoon sorbet into a container, cover tightly, and store in the freezer. It will keep for up to 2 weeks."
