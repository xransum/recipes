  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Dust with flour; shake out excess. Place dishes in roasting pan. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup flour; whisk 1 minute. Gradually add milk and whisk until mixture is thick and smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cheese and whisk until melted and smooth. Whisk in egg yolks, pepper, and kosher salt. Cool soufflé base 15 minutes.",
    "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into soufflé base in 2 additions (mixture will be runny). Divide soufflé among prepared dishes. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dishes. Bake until soufflés are slightly puffed and golden on top, about 35 minutes (soufflés may not rise above rim of dishes). (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Remove souffl��s from water bath; let stand at room temperature. Place soufflé dishes on baking sheet and rewarm in 350°F oven 10 minutes.)",
    "Divide Endive and Asian Pear Salad among 6 plates. Place 1 soufflé dish alongside salad on each plate and serve."
