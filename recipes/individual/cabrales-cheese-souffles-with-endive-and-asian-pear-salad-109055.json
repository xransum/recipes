        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter six 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes or custard cups. Dust with flour; shake out excess. Place dishes in roasting pan. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup flour; whisk 1 minute. Gradually add milk and whisk until mixture is thick and smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cheese and whisk until melted and smooth. Whisk in egg yolks, pepper, and kosher salt. Cool souffl\u00e9 base 15 minutes.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into souffl\u00e9 base in 2 additions (mixture will be runny). Divide souffl\u00e9 among prepared dishes. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dishes. Bake until souffl\u00e9s are slightly puffed and golden on top, about 35 minutes (souffl\u00e9s may not rise above rim of dishes). (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Remove souffl\ufffd\ufffds from water bath; let stand at room temperature. Place souffl\u00e9 dishes on baking sheet and rewarm in 350\u00b0F oven 10 minutes.)",
