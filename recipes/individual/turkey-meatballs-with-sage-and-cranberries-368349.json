        "Heat a small pan over medium heat; add pine nuts and stir until aromatic and light brown, a few minutes. In a bowl, combine all ingredients from turkey through pepper, being careful not to overmix. Cover and chill for at least 2 1/2 hours. (Chilling will help meatballs keep their shape while cooking.) Heat oven to 400\u00b0. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper; brush paper with oil. Roll meat into 1-inch balls; place on baking sheet 1/2 inch apart. Bake until balls are brown and bounce back to the touch, and internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove; let rest. Serve warm with chutney, if desired. DO AHEAD: These savory bites can be made up to 48 hours in advance. Store, covered, in the fridge; reheat at 250\u00b0F for 15 minutes."
