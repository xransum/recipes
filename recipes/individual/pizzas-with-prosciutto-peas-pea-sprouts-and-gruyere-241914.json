    "Pour warm water into large bowl; sprinkle yeast over. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt. Mix in 3 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition, until sticky dough forms. Knead dough on floured surface until smooth, adding more flour if very sticky, about 6 minutes.",
