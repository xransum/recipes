        "Working with one brussels sprout at a time, peel each individual leaf, starting from the outside and working toward the middle. Continue to peel until you get to the tough core where it is just too tight to pull any more leaves. Discard the core and put the leaves in a big bowl. Repeat with the remaining brussels sprouts.",
        "Over medium heat, warm the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add all of the brussels leaves and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds. Add the vinegar and maple syrup and toss to coat. Add the spinach to the pan and toss until it is just barely wilted. It is better just slightly underdone in this case, as it will continue to cook in its own heat.",
        "Sprinkle with the salt and Marcona almonds and serve immediately."
