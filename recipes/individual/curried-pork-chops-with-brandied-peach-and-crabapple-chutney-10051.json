In a 9-inch heavy non-stick skillet, heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot, but not smoking and brown pork chops about 3 minutes on each side. Pour off any excess fat and reduce heat to moderately low. Add reserved syrup and remaining teaspoon vinegar and simmer, covered, 10 minutes, or until meat is just cooked through. Transfer pork chops to plates and keep warm. Boil pan juices until thickened, about 15 seconds, and spoon over pork chops. Serve pork chops with chutney."
