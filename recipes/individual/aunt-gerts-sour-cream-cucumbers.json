        "Layer 1/4 of the sliced cucumbers and 1/4 of the onion in a large bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt. Repeat the layers 3 more times. Cover and allow to rest on the counter until the cucumbers and onion releases about 1 inch of liquid and are softened, 3 to 4 hours.",
        "Drain cucumbers and onion in a colander and thoroughly rinse to remove any remaining salt. Let the vegetables continue to drain in the colander for 30 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl, then stir in the sour cream. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes."
