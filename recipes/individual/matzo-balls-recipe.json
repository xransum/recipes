        "Beat the eggs, oil, and seasonings in a mixing bowl. Fold in the matzo meal and mix until fully incorporated. Store the mixture, covered, in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours, or overnight.",
        "Boil 12 cups of water in a 4 to 5-quart saucepan. With greased hands, roll the batter into about 12 balls, a little smaller than ping-pong ball size, and drop into the boiling water. After about 5 minutes the matzo balls will begin to rise to the top of the water, and you can stir them gently. Boil until doubled in size, about 15 minutes total.",
        "Serve in chicken soup or use as a dumpling for other soups. Cooked matzo balls may be stored in the refrigerator, covered in water, up to 3 days."
