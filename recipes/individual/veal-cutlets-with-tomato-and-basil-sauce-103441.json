  "directions": [
    "Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper; dust with flour to coat lightly. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add veal to skillet and sauté until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer veal to plate. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to same skillet. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes with juices, basil, parsley, oregano and dried red pepper. Bring sauce to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until flavors blend and sauce thickens slightly, scraping up browned bits, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange cutlets atop sauce. Top each with cheese. Cover; simmer until veal is tender and cheese melts, about 5 minutes."
