        "Divide butter between 2 heavy large skillets and melt over medium heat. Divide onions between skillets and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to high. Divide chicken, potatoes and squash between skillets and cook until vegetables are golden brown, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes. Divide artichoke hearts, cream, Parmesan and 2 tablespoons tarragon between skillets. Boil until cream thickens and coats hash well and chicken is cooked through, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish hash with tarragon sprigs, if desired, and serve."
