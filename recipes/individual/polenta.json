        "Bring water to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer. Pour in polenta steadily, stirring constantly.  Continue to stir until polenta is thickened.  It should come away from sides of the pan, and be able to support a spoon.  This can take anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes. Pour polenta onto a wooden cutting board, let stand for a few minutes."
