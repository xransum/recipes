    "Sprinkle turkey fillets with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey and cook until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer turkey to 2 plates. Tent with foil to keep warm.",
    "Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and shallots; stir to blend. Cover and cook until mushrooms soften and release juices, about 5 minutes. Uncover and sauté until tender, about 2 minutes longer. Stir in chicken broth, Sherry, and half of tarragon. Boil until thickened to sauce consistency, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes. Spoon mushroom sauce over turkey. Sprinkle with remaining tarragon and serve."
