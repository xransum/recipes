        "Cut the lemon into quarters. Rub the outside of the chicken with one of the lemon quarters, then discard. In a small bowl, stir together the lemon and orange zests and 1 tablespoon of the grated ginger. Rub this mixture evenly in the cavity. Put the lemon and orange quarters inside the bird. Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper. In the now-empty small bowl, combine the melted margarine or olive oil, lemon and orange juices, honey, and the remaining 2 tablespoons ginger. Mix well.",

        "Transfer to a serving platter and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Carve the chicken. Garnish with orange sections.",
        "Variation: Use 4 tablespoons pomegranate juice in place of the lemon juice."
