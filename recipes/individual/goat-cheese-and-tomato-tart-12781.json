        "In the bowl of an electric mixer stir together the yeast, the sugar, and 1/3 cup lukewarm water and proof the yeast mixture for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy. Stir in an additional 1/3 cup lukewarm water, the oil, the cornmeal, 1 1/2 cups of the flour, and the salt and blend the mixture, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, as necessary to form a dough. Knead the dough, incorporating as much of the remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough, for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk, and punch it down. Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface, fit it into a greased 15- by 10 1/2-inch jelly-roll pan, crimping the edges decoratively, and bake the crust in the bottom third of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is pale golden. Transfer the crust on the pan to a rack and let it cool for 10 minutes. The crust may be made 1 day in advance and kept, covered tightly with plastic wrap, at room temperature.",
        "In a bowl whisk together the scallion, the goat cheese, the eggs, the cream, the minced basil, salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth.",
        "In a large skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat hot but not smoking and in it saut\u00e9 half the tomatoes with half the garlic for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are browned lightly, transferring them as they are saut\u00e9ed to a plate. Saut\u00e9 the remaining tomatoes with the remaining garlic in the same manner.",
        "Spread the custard evenly over the crust and arrange the tomatoes in rows on it. Bake the tart in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the custard is pale golden and set. Remove the tart carefully from the baking sheet with 2 spatulas and let it cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Garnish the tart with the basil sprigs and serve it at room temperature."
