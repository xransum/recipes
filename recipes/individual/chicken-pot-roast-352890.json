        "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.",
        "2. Melt the butter with the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof casserole over medium heat. Brown the chicken in batches, about 8 minutes per batch, being careful not to pierce the skin. Remove to a plate.",
        "3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the carrots, onion, garlic, and tarragon; cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Return the chicken and any juices to the casserole, arranging the pieces atop the vegetables. Cover and bake in the oven for 1 hour, basting occasionally. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately."
