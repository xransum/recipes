        "Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from orange in strips. Place orange peel in heavy large pot (reserve orange for another use). Add apple cider, golden brown sugar, fresh lemon juice, cloves, allspice, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks to pot. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until cider mixture is reduced to generous 8 cups, about 40 minutes. Strain cider into medium pot. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.) Rewarm cider. Ladle into mugs."
