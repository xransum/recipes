        "In a small skillet cook shallots in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in tomato and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, 30 seconds, or until just heated through. In a bowl toss together tomato mixture with cheese, chives, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and mound about 1 tablespoon on oiled side of each toast.",
        "Prepare grill or preheat broiler.",
        "With a serrated knife cut bread crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Grill slices on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp outside but still soft inside. Alternatively, slices may be broiled in batches under a broiler about 4 inches from heat 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until golden. Rub toasts with garlic on one side and lightly brush same side with oil. Toasts may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container. Makes about 45 toasts."
