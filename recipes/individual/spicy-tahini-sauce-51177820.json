    "In a small bowl mix the tahini, water and lemon juice until creamy (it should look like smooth cake batter) and set aside. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil and sauté the garlic for 1 minute, then add the cilantro and hot chilies and stir for another minute. Pour in the tahini mixture and whisk to combine. Season with salt to taste. It should be a creamy pourable consistency—add a small amount of water if needed. Allow to simmer for 5 minutes to let the flavors mingle. Remove from heat and stir in the toasted pine nuts. Serve hot."
