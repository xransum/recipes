        "For mousse: Line 12-cup ring mold with plastic wrap, allowing plastic to overhang edges by 3 inches. Whisk first 6 ingredients in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water); whisk until candy thermometer registers 180\u00b0F, about 7 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until cool and thick, about 8 minutes.",
