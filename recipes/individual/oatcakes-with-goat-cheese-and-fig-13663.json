        "In a food processor pulse oats until chopped fine. Add flour, salt, baking powder, and butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and pulse until a dough just forms. On a lightly floured surface roll out dough 1/8 inch thick (about a 13-inch round) and using a 1 1/2-inch cutter cut out about 60 oatcakes. Arrange oatcakes on baking sheets 1 inch apart and bake in middle of oven 12 minutes (oatcakes will not change color). Transfer oatcakes to a rack and cool completely.",
