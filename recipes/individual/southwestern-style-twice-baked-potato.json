        "Scoop out the centers of the potato halves, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato in the skin to keep its shape. Place skins on a greased baking sheet and place the scoopings into a bowl. Mash the potato in the bowl with milk, salt, pepper and butter until smooth, or as smooth as you prefer. Stir in the green and red peppers, jalapeno and garlic until evenly distributed. Mound the mixture into the potato skins. Sprinkle cheese and bacon bits over the top.",
