        "Cut the beef across the grain into slices 1\u20448 inch thick. Working on a cutting board, use the side of the blade of a chef's knife or cleaver to mash together three-fourths of the chopped garlic and the 1 Tbs. sugar, forming a paste. Place the paste in a bowl and stir in 3 Tbs. of the light soy sauce, the dark soy sauce, the 1 Tbs. sesame oil, 1 Tbs. of the vinegar, all but 1 Tbs. of the minced green onions, the ginger, 1 Tbs. of the sesame seeds, the black pepper and 1 Tbs. of the water. Place the beef in a shallow bowl and pour the marinade on top. Mix well, cover and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: On a cutting board, use the side of the blade of a chef's knife or cleaver to mash together the remaining chopped garlic and the 1\u20442 tsp. sugar, forming a paste.

Working in batches, arrange the beef in a single layer on the grill or in the grill pan. Sear, turning once, until crisp and brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Wipe and oil the rack or pan between batches, if necessary.",
