        "Unfold puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll into a 12\" square about 1/8\" thick. Using a 12\" plate as a guide, cut out a 12\" round with a sharp paring knife. Transfer pastry round to a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use.",
        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Swirl butter and maple syrup in a 12\" heavy ovenproof skillet over medium heat until butter melts. Sprinkle sugar over, evenly coating bottom of skillet. Add apples, cut side down; increase heat to medium-high and cook until sugar melts, occasionally swirling apples in pan, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, continuing to swirl apples in pan, about 5 minutes longer. Flip apples (rounded side down), and cook, swirling apples occasionally, until syrup is thick and golden brown, 5-10 minutes longer.",
        "Cover apples with pastry round, tucking in edges of pastry. Bake until pastry is light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375\u00b0F; bake until pastry is puffed and deep golden, about 20 minutes longer.",
        "Let tarte Tatin cool for 15 minutes. Invert a serving plate over skillet. Using oven mitts, firmly hold plate and skillet and invert tarte onto plate. Remove skillet; rearrange apples if needed and scrape any caramel in skillet over. Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream."
