        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. and wrap handle of a 12-inch non-stick skillet with a triple-layer of foil, shiny side out, if handle is not ovenproof. Remove fish from marinade, letting excess marinade drip off, and put on a plate. Discard excess marinade. In non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sear fish on 1 side only until golden brown, about 3 minutes. With tongs turn fish over and transfer skillet to middle of oven. Roast fish until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve sea bass with curry sauce."
