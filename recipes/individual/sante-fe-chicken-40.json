        "Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 chicken until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Add garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add stewed tomatoes, yam, chilis, broth, 6 tablespoons cilantro and taco sauce. Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is just tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate. Add hominy to skillet and boil until yam is tender and juices are reduced to sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return chicken and any collected juices to skillet. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat gently before continuing.) Transfer to large deep serving platter. Garnish with remaining cilantro."
