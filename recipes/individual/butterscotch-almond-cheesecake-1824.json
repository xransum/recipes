Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns golden, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped into water and swirling pan. Add 2/3 cup cream and butter (mixture will bubble) and stir until smooth. Cool 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon Scotch. Let stand until cool but still pourable, about 2 hours. Mix in 1/2 cup almonds.",
