        "Remove the large cut of meat from the refrigerator1 hour before putting on the grill to allow the internal temperature of the meat to come down.",
        "Brush the meat with oil to keep it moist and from sticking to the grates. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and the dried herbs. Make slits in the meat with a sharp knife and insert the garlic cloves.",
        "Prepare a charcoal grill for indirect grilling. The temperature inside the grill should be 300 to 325 degrees F.",
        "Place the meat, bone-side down, on the rack directly in the center of the grill. Cover with the lid. Grill until an instant-read thermometer registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
        "Let the meat rest before carving."
