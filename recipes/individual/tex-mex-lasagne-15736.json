In a 12-inch skillet cook onion, bell pepper, and garlic with salt and pepper to taste in 3 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened. Add chicken and spices and cook, stirring, until most of chicken begins to turn opaque on outside, about 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar and 1 1/4 cups beer, reserving remainder, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until chicken is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.",
