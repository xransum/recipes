        "In a large skillet cook the onions in 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat, stirring, until they are softened and transfer them to a food processor. In the skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it saut\u00e9 the chicken livers, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until they are browned on the outside but still pink within. Transfer the livers to the food processor. Add the Port to the skillet, bring it to a boil, and deglaze the skillet, scraping up the brown bits, for 1 minute. Add the Port to the food processor with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, softened, the allspice, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, pur\u00e9e the mixture until it is smooth, and force it through a fine sieve into a bowl. Line an oiled 1 1/2-quart terrine or straight-sided dish with plastic wrap and pour the p\u00e2t\u00e9, covered, for 5 hours, or until it is firm. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 may be made 4 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Invert the p\u00e2t\u00e9 onto a plate, discarding the plastic wrap, and smooth the top and sides. Spread the preserves on the top and serve the p\u00e2t\u00e9 with the toast points or water biscuits."
