        "Place the cinnamon sticks, allspice berries, and cloves onto the center of a 8 inch square piece of cheesecloth. Gather together the edges of the cheesecloth, and tie with kitchen twine to secure. Place the sachet into a large saucepan along with the cranberries and orange juice. Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook until the berries begin to burst, about 10 minutes.",
        "Stir in the apples, pears, white sugar, and brown sugar. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer about 25 minutes until the apples and pears are slightly soft. Remove and discard the spice sachet. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold."
