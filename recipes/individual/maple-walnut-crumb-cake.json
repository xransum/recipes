In the bowl with the smaller amount, stir in the eggs, oil, milk, vanilla extract and maple extract. Pour this mixture into the prepared baking pan. To the remaining bowl, stir in the butter, cinnamon and walnuts until crumbly and well blended. Sprinkle this over the top of the batter in the pan.",
