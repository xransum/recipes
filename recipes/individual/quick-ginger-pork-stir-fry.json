        "Whisk soy sauce, cider vinegar, brown sugar, hoisin sauce, garlic, and salt together in a large glass or ceramic bowl until marinade is smooth. Transfer 1 tablespoon marinade to a separate small bowl. Add pork to remaining marinade in the large bowl and toss to coat. Let marinate briefly, about 10 minutes.",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat until glistening. Cook and stir pork pieces in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return skillet to heat.",
        "Stir red bell pepper and onion into the same skillet and drizzle remaining oil over the top. Cook and stir until vegetables are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and water chestnuts to onion mixture, drizzle 1 tablespoon reserved marinade over the top and sprinkle with ginger and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender yet still crisp to the bite, about 5 minutes. Return pork to skillet; cook and stir until heated through, about 1 minute more."
