        "1. Combine all the ingredients in a blender and mix until a thin batter forms. Chill the batter for at least 1 hour before using. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.",
        "2. Heat an 8-inch nonstick saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Brush the bottom and sides of the pan with some of the melted butter reserved for this purpose.",
        "3. Stir the chilled batter. Add about 2 tablespoons of batter to the pan while swirling it. This ensures a thin layer of the batter all over the pan. You want thin cr\u00eapes. Let the cr\u00eape cook for about 30 seconds or until it gets lightly golden. Tuck in the sides with a rubber spatula. Using a spatula or even your hands (careful!), quickly flip the cr\u00eape over and finish cooking. The first cr\u00eape is usually a test one, so don't worry if it sticks. Transfer it to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter. Stack all the cr\u00eapes. They should not stick together.",
        "4. At this point, you can fill them with anything or freeze them, stacked and tightly wrapped, for up to 1 month.",
        "1. In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the cloves of garlic and gently let the garlic infuse the oil for 1 to 2 minutes; then remove it. Do not burn the garlic.",
        "2. Add the mushrooms and thyme. Cook for another couple of minutes, until soft and slightly caramelized. Season with the salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.",
        "3. Add about 2 tablespoons of filling and a sprinkle of parsley to each cr\u00eape and roll them up. Serve immediately."
