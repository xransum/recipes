        "Dust the veal shanks with the flour blended with the salt. Brown over high heat in the oil and butter. Lower heat, add the water and wine slowly, stirring to blend and let simmer gently. Crush the garlic and mash to a paste with the herbs. Blend in the tomato paste and add this mixture to the broth with the chopped onions and the lemon zest (only the yellow part of the rind, none of the white). Cook covered at least 2 hours, until meat is nearly falling from bones. During last half hour, add carrots and celery stalk and leaves. Cook until carrots are tender. Transfer meat to a platter. Strain the sauce and thicken if desired with 2 tablespoons butter worked into a ball with 2 tablespoons flour and an additional teaspoon minced parsley. Add to sauce, simmer until smooth. Serve with noodles."
