        "In a bowl cream the butter and the shortening with the sugars and beat in the egg, the baking soda mixture, the flour, the salt, and the vanilla. Stir in the oats, the coconut, the chocolate chips, the peanuts, and the raisins. Drop rounded tablespoons of the dough about 4 inches apart onto greased baking sheets and with a fork flatten and spread each mound into a round, about 3 inches in diameter. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them with a metal spatula to racks, and let them cool."
