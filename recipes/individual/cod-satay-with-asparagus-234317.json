    "Combine marinade ingredients. Reserve 2 tbsp and marinate cod in the rest (covered, refrigerated) for 24 hours. Spear each piece of fish on a wooden skewer. Place on foil-lined pan and broil until sauce caramelizes, 3 or 4 minutes. Toss asparagus with oil, salt and pepper. Heat a sauté pan (no oil) over high heat, about 7 minutes. Sauté asparagus on all sides; arrange on a plate. Top with cod, drizzle with reserved marinade and garnish with chives. (To evaporate alcohol, increase sake and mirin to 1 1/4 cups each. Simmer until reduced by half and syrupy.)"
