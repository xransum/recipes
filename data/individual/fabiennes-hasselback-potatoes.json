Transfer potatoes to a baking dish and reserve oil mixture in a small bowl. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the potatoes.",

Brush potatoes with reserved oil mixture, pulling layers apart if they are sticking together. Continue baking until potatoes are crispy on the edges and easily pierced with knife, 30 to 40 minutes more."
