        "Quarter the potatoes lengthwise and cut them crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. In a vegetable steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are tender, and transfer them to a large bowl. In a large heavy skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 4 tablespoons of the fat, to the skillet add the onion and the celery, and cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. Add the sugar, the flour, and the celery seeds, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the mustard, the vinegar, and 1/2 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it for 2 minutes, or until it is thickened. Season the dressing with salt and pepper, pour it over the potatoes, and stir in the eggs, the pickles, the bacon, and the scallion greens. Serve the salad warm."
