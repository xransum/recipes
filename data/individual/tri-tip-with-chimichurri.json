        "Meanwhile, prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Place steak over indirect heat, cover grill, and grill, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 115\u00b0F, 20\u201330 minutes. Move steak to direct heat and grill until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120\u00b0F for medium-rare (temperature will continue to rise off heat). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.",
