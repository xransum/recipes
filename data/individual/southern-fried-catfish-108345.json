        "Whisk together egg, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Pulse saltines in a food processor until finely ground, then stir together with cayenne and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a shallow baking dish.",
        "Dip 1 catfish fillet into egg mixture, letting excess drip off, then dredge in saltines to coat and transfer to a wax-paper-lined tray. Coat remaining fillets in same manner.",
        "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F.",
        "Heat oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until it registers 360\u00b0F on thermometer. Carefully lower 1 fillet into oil (temperature of oil will drop to 340\u00b0F), then fry until golden and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer fillet with a slotted spatula to a rack set over paper towels to drain briefly, then transfer to a shallow baking pan and keep hot in oven. Fry remaining fillets in same manner, returning oil to 360\u00b0F each time."
