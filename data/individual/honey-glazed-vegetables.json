        "Combine vegetables, butter, honey, a generous pinch of salt, and 1 cup water in a large saut\u00e9 pan or saucepan over medium-high. Cover, bring to a simmer, and cook, adding water by the tablespoonful if pan is dry before vegetables are done, until vegetables are nearly crisp-tender (they should still be firm in the center), 12\u201315 minutes. Remove lid and cook until liquid evaporates completely, about 5 minutes, then continue to cook, tossing vegetables occasionally, until browned in the remaining butter and honey, about 5 minutes. Add 1 Tbsp. water and toss vegetables to deglaze pan and coat; season with salt."
