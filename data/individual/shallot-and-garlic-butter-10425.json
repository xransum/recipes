        "In a small saucepan of boiling water boil the garlic cloves for 6 minutes, drain them, and peel them. In a small heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry the shallot for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is golden. Transfer the fried shallot to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl mash the garlic to a paste, add the fried shallot, the butter, and salt and pepper to taste, and cream the mixture. Let the butter stand, covered, in a cool place for 1 hour to allow the flavors to develop. Serve the butter with meat, poultry, seafood, or vegetables."
