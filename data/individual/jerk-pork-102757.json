        "Put pork in bag, turning to coat, and seal bag. Marinate pork, chilled, turning occasionally, 8 hours. Brush a well-seasoned cast-iron ridged grill pan lightly with some oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Grill pork, seasoned with salt, in batches over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through, about 9 minutes on each side. (Discard any remaining marinade in bag.) Transfer pork to a plate to cool slightly. With your fingers, shred warm pork into a bowl and toss with oil, scallion, and salt to taste. Keep warm, covered."
