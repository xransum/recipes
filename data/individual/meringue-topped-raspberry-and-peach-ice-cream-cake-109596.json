Cool crust completely, then freeze 15 minutes.",

Place pan in freezer 15 minutes. Microwave raspberry sorbet on low in three 10-second intervals until slightly softened. Spoon sorbet in large dollops atop peach ice cream, then spread in even layer. Return pan to freezer 15 minutes. Repeat procedure with vanilla ice cream. Freeze until filling is firm, about 4 hours.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy. Add cream of tartar and salt; beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Spoon meringue atop cake, mounding in center and spreading completely to edge of pan. Using rubber spatula or knife, swirl meringue decoratively, creating pointy tips. Freeze 2 hours. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen.)",
