        "Place the beef into a vacuum-sealable bag. Add the wine, garlic, sliced shallots, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, peppercorns and 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; be sure you have a smooth, airtight seal. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.",
        "Prepare a sous vide immersion circulator for use according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Preheat the water to 120\u00b0F, 30 minutes to 1 hour.",
        "Carefully place the bag into the circulating water and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the bag from the circulating water and let rest for 5 minutes. Open the bag and remove the beef, wiping off any large pieces of garlic or shallots. Season the beef with kosher salt.",
        "In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil until just smoking. Add the beef and sear until browned on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard and chopped shallots. Slowly whisk in the remaining 6 Tbs. olive oil. Season the vinaigrette with kosher salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the mesclun, onion and tomatoes. Add the vinaigrette and toss gently. Divide the salad among 4 plates. Top with the avocado. Slice the beef across the grain and arrange on the salads. Sprinkle with Maldon sea salt and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
