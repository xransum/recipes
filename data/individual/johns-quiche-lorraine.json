        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fit the pie crust into a quiche pan or 9-inch pie dish, and cover the crust with a sheet of aluminum foil. Fill the crust with pie weights or dried beans.",
        "Bake the crust in the preheated oven just until the edges begin to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and take out the pie weights and aluminum foil.",
        "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the bacon until browned, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, then sprinkle the bacon into the partially-baked crust. Whisk the cream, eggs, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg together in a bowl, and pour into the crust.",
        "Return to oven, and bake until the filling is set in the middle and the quiche is puffy and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool until warm, about 1 hour, to serve."
