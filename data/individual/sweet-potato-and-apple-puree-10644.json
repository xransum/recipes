        "In a large saucepan boil the sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, in water to cover for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are very tender. While the sweet potatoes are boiling, in a large skillet cook the onion and the apples, peeled, cored, and sliced thin, with salt and pepper to taste in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the apples are very tender. Drain the sweet potatoes well, in a food processor pur\u00e9e them with the apple mixture until the mixture is smooth, and with the motor running add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, the nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, and enough hot water to thin the pur\u00e9 to the desired consistency."
