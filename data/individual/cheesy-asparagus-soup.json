        "Heat butter and olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.",
        "Stir flour into onion mixture until combined, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups chicken stock; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Add cooked asparagus stalks and remaining reserved asparagus-chicken stock; bring soup to a boil.",
        "Heat half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium heat until warmed slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add warmed half-and-half to soup, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.",
