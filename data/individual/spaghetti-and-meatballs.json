        "For the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.",
        "Combine the bread with the milk in a large bowl. Let soften for about 1 minute, then mash to a paste with a fork. Add the beef, pork, egg, Worcestershire, granulated garlic, granulated onion, 2 tablespoons pecorino, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Mix until well blended. Form into twelve 2-inch balls (about 1/4 cup each) and place on a plate or tray.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the meatballs on all sides until a crust forms, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking dish.",
        "Bake until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.",
        "For the pasta and sauce: In a large pot, cook the spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and set aside.",
        "To a pan over medium heat, add the olive oil, tomatoes, broth, butter, and basil and parsley. Simmer until the tomatoes are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the pecorino to help thicken the sauce, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir in the cooked pasta and top with the meatballs. Garnish with some more pecorino and basil-parsley mix."
