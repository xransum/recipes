        "Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into skillet, using back of spoon to flatten latkes slightly. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to paper towels to drain. Add more butter and oil to skillet as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter. Transfer latkes to plates.
