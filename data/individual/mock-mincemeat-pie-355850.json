        "Place crusts on 2 rimless baking sheets and chill while preparing filling.",
        "Place 1/3 of apples in processor. Using on/off turns, chop into small pieces. Transfer chopped apples to large saucepan. Repeat chopping remaining apples in 2 more batches in processor; add to saucepan. Place all dried fruit in processor. Using on/off turns, chop until beginning to stick together. Add dried fruits to saucepan with apples. Add sugar, molasses, rum, brandy, cornstarch, butter, orange peel, lemon peel, spices, and sea salt; stir to blend. Simmer over medium-low heat until mixture is very thick, stirring often to prevent scorching, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer pie filling to large bowl and cool completely, about 1 hour.",
        "Position rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Transfer 1 crust to 9-inch glass pie dish, leaving dough overhang. Spread cooled filling in crust. Cut second crust into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 6 dough strips atop filling, spacing 1 inch apart. Place 6 dough strips at 45-degree angle to first strips, forming diamond lattice pattern. Trim strip ends even with bottom crust. Fold crust edge and strips in; press edge with tines of fork to seal. (Feeling ambitious? Click here for tips on making a woven lattice crust.) Whisk cream and sugar in small bowl to blend for glaze. Brush glaze over lattice.",
        "Bake pie 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and continue to bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool completely for filling to set. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving. If desired, rewarm pie in 325\u00b0F oven 10 to 15 minutes before serving.",
