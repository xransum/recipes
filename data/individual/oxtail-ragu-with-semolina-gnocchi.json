        "Toss oxtails, flour, pepper, 2 Tbsp. or 1 Tbsp. salt in a large bowl until oxtails are evenly coated. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches, cook oxtails in a single layer, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer oxtails to a plate as they\u2019re done.",
        "Cook onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and rosemary in same pot, stirring often, until vegetables are browned around edges, 10\u201315 minutes. Add wine, tomatoes, vinegar, and honey, stirring and scraping up browned bits; bring to a boil. Season with several generous pinches of salt and return oxtails to pot. Pour in water just to cover oxtails; bring to a gentle simmer. Partially cover and cook, reducing heat as needed to keep at a bare simmer, until meat is falling off the bone, 3\u20133 1/2 hours. Let cool; cover and chill at least 12 hours.",
        "Line a 13x9\" baking dish with parchment paper, leaving overhang on 2 sides. Bring milk, butter, and several pinches of salt to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium. Gradually whisk in semolina and cook, whisking, until very thick and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; add 1 cup Parmesan and whisk until smooth. Whisk in egg yolk and scrape gnocchi mixture into prepared pan; smooth top. Cover and chill until set, at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, remove rag\u00f9 from fridge and skim fat from surface. Warm rag\u00f9 over low until heated through, then transfer oxtails to a plate. Increase heat to medium and bring braising liquid to a simmer. Cook until reduced to the consistency of gravy, 5\u201310 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pick meat from bones and shred into small pieces. Return meat to rag\u00f9; discard bones. Transfer 2 cups rag\u00f9 to an airtight container and save for later. Cover pot; keep remaining rag\u00f9 warm over low heat.",
        "Turn out gnocchi mixture onto a clean surface and remove parchment paper; slice into about 1\" squares.",
        "Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add half of gnocchi to skillet, arrange in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until browned and crisp underneath, about 3 minutes. Toss to turn and cook until other side is browned and crisp, about 2 minutes. Spoon into pot with rag\u00f9. Repeat with remaining gnocchi. Gently toss gnocchi in rag\u00f9; season with more salt if needed. Divide among bowls; top with parsley and more Parmesan.",
        "Rag\u00f9 can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 4 weeks."
