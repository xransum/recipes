        "Cut the avocado into quarters and remove the pit. Cut each quarter into 3 slices. Fan each quarter of the avocado towards the side of each salad plate. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce mix with tomatoes. Pour dressing over the lettuce and tomato, and toss to coat. Portion the salad onto the plates so that the ends of the avocado fan are showing. Sprinkle each plate with pine nuts, and garnish with a daisy bud."
