        "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. and butter well twelve 1/2-cup muffin tins. In a bowl whisk together the cornmeal, the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt. In another bowl whisk together the eggs, the yogurt, and the butter, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Fold in the raspberries gently, divide the batter among the muffin tins, and bake the muffins in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the muffins cool in the tins on a rack for 3 minutes, turn them out onto the rack, and let them cool completely. The muffins may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container."
