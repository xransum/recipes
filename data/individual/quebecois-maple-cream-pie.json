        "Whisk egg yolks and egg together in a large bowl. Very gradually add the cream mixture to the eggs, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking constantly. Stir in salt, vanilla extract, and vinegar. Pour the batter into the prepared pie crust.",
        "Bake until the pie is mostly set but jiggles slightly when moved, about 1 hour. Let cool before serving."
