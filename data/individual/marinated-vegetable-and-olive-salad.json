Drain, and rinse under cold water until the green beans are cool. Place into a bowl along with the broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, tomatoes, and olives; set aside.",
        "Whisk together the vinegar, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, garlic salt, and dill in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to whisk to create a dressing.
