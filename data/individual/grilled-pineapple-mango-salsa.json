        "Cook the pineapple, red bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until the pineapple has mild grill marks and the peppers are browned on all sides, about 3 minutes for pineapple and 5 to 7 minutes for peppers. Carefully remove from grill and place peppers in paper bag to cool.",
        "After peppers are cool, rub skins off gently with paper towels, cut in half, and remove and discard seeds. Cut the cooled pineapple and peppers into a small dice and place into a bowl. Add the mango, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and lime zest; stir to combine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours to 1 day before serving."
