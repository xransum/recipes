        "Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. If not stuffing turkey, fill main cavity and neck cavity with orange quarters, onion, garlic, celery, thyme sprigs, and sage sprigs. If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into both cavities.

Roast turkey 45 minutes. Add 2 cups broth to pan; baste turkey. Turn pan around. Roast turkey 45 minutes. Add 1 cup broth; baste with pan juices. Turn pan around and cover turkey loosely with foil. Continue to roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175\u00b0F, basting with 1 cup broth and rotating pan every 45 minutes, about 1 hour 45 minutes longer if unstuffed and 2 hours 15 minutes longer if stuffed. Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees).",
