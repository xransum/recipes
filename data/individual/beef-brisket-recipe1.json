Cook in the oven or smoker until the internal temperature on an instant- read meat thermometer reaches 175 degrees F, about 6 to 8 hours. Remove the meat from the oven or smoker and wrap in a double layer of aluminum foil to seal in the juices. Turn the foiled meat upside down and place it back in the oven or smoker for 1 more hour.
