        "Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Combine peaches, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, flour and cardamom in large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; discard bean. Toss to blend well. Let stand until dry ingredients are moistened, about 15 minutes.",
        "Roll out 1 pie-crust disk on lightly floured surface to 12 1/2-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Spoon peach filling into crust, mounding slightly in center. Roll out second pie-crust disk to 12-inch round. Drape crust over filling. Trim overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold edge of top and bottom crusts under, pressing to seal. Crimp edges decoratively. Cut 4 slits in top crust to allow steam to escape during baking. Brush crust lightly with whipping cream. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.",
        "Place pie on baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes. Cover crust edges with foil to prevent overbrowning. Continue to bake until crust is golden and juices bubble thickly, about 1 hour longer. Cool completely on rack."
