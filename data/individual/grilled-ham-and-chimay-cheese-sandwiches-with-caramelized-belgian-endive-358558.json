        "Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add endive leaves and saut\u00e9 until almost translucent and beginning to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle sugar over and saut\u00e9 until endive leaves begin to brown and edges are deep golden brown, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes. Add beer and orange juice and boil until liquid is reduced to thick glaze and coats endive leaves, 3 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let cool to room temperature.",
