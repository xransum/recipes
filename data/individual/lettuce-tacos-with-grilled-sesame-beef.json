        "In a shallow, nonreactive baking dish, combine half of the green onions, the garlic, soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil and red pepper flakes. Add the steak and turn to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or for up to overnight, turning the steak from time to time.",
        "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct-heat grilling over high heat.",
        "While the grill is heating, in a small, dry frying pan over medium heat, toast the sesame seeds, shaking the pan frequently, until pale gold and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour onto a plate and let cool.",
        "Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place on the grill rack and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until done to your liking. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes.",
        "Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the steak on the diagonal across the grain and then cut it crosswise into small pieces. Arrange the lettuce cups on a platter. Divide the steak among the cups, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and the remaining green onions and serve right away. Makes 12 tacos; serves 3 or 4.",
