        "Remove any pin bones from fish fillets (using tweezers makes this easy). Cut each fillet in half lengthwise. Cut each half on a diagonal into 1\" strips. (Work with the natural shape of the fish as you cut; this will help the pieces stay together instead of falling apart when frying.)",
        "Whisk all-purpose flour, rice flour, and salt in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in club soda until no lumps remain; adjust with more club soda or rice flour as needed to make it the consistency of thin pancake batter\u2014it should be pourable, but thick enough to coat the fish.",
        "Fit a large pot with a deep-fry thermometer and pour in oil to measure 2\". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350\u00b0.",
        "Working in batches of 5\u20137 pieces at a time, coat fish in batter, letting excess drip off, then carefully place in oil (to avoid splattering, lower fish into oil pointing away from you). Don\u2019t overcrowd the pot: The oil temperature will drop dramatically and fish may stick together.",
        "Fry fish, turning occasionally with a fish spatula or slotted spoon and maintaining oil temperature at 350\u00b0, until crust is puffed, crisp, and golden brown, about 5 minutes.",
        "Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season immediately with salt.",
        "While fish is frying, use tongs to heat tortillas one at a time directly over a gas burner, moving them often, until lightly charred and puffed in spots, about 1 minute per side.",
        "Transfer to a plate; cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. (If you don\u2019t have a gas stove, wrap up a stack of tortillas in a sheet of foil and heat in a 350\u00b0 oven until warmed through.)",
        "Top tortillas (we like two per taco) with fish, slaw, hot sauce, avocado, cilantro, and pickled jalape\u00f1os. Serve with lime wedges."
