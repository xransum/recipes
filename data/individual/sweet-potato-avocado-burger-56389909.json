        "Wash and pat your sweet potatoes dry. Cut the sweet potatoes into small 1-inch cubes. Roast the sweet potato cubes with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon granulated garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place onto a sheet tray and roast at 375\u00b0 F for approximately 40 minutes, remove from the oven, and cool slightly.",
        "In a food processor, add the roasted/cooked sweet potato, tamari soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce; pulse to combine. Add the onion and chickpeas and pulse until fully combined, periodically stopping the food processor and using a spatula or wooden spoon to move the mixture around. Mix just until the chickpeas and onion are fully incorporated; look for the consistency of mashed potatoes. Do not overmix.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the oats, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseed meal.",
        "Remove the sweet potato mixture from the food processor and fold into the dry ingredients. Measure out 1/3 cup of the mixture at a time and, using your hands, form into round burger-shaped patties.",
        "In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the patties and saut\u00e9 for about 4 minutes per side, or until they are warmed through and golden brown on each side.",
        "To serve, place the patties on toasted buns, if desired, and add your choice of toppings. I love avocado, kale, and Worcestershire sauce."
