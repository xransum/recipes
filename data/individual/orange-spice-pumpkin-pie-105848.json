        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Fold overhang under and crimp decoratively. Pierce dough all over with fork. Freeze 15 minutes. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set, about 12 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake until crust begins to color, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer crust to rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Whisk pumpkin and brown sugar in medium bowl to blend. Add all remaining ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour filling into crust. Bake pie until filling is set in center, about 1 hour. Transfer pie to rack; cool 30 minutes. Chill uncovered until cold, at least 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep chilled.)"
