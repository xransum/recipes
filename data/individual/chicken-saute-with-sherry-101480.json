        "Melt butter in skillet and saut\u00e9 chicken pieces, turning to color on all sides-do not let them get too brown, the chicken should be just a delicate golden color. Reduce flame and add salt, pepper, and ginger. Add 1/2 cup sherry and cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes, turning chicken once or twice to bathe it evently in the juices. When tender remove to a hot platter. Add remaining sherry to pan, turn up heat, cook, and stir, scraping up the brown crust from the pan and blending it into the sauce. When blended and hot, pour sauce over chicken. Serve with saut\u00e9ed or fried potatoes and a green salad. With this, drink a dry white wine."
