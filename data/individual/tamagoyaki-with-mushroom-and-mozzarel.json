        "Beat eggs, sugar, salt, pepper, and red chile powder together in a bowl.",
        "Coat the skillet with some vegetable oil; set over medium heat. Pour in some of the beaten eggs, tilting skillet to spread into a thin layer. Cook until almost set, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a heatproof rubber spatula around the edges to loosen. Cover with some mushrooms; roll up egg and move to the side of the skillet.",
        "Grease skillet with some more vegetable oil. Pour in more eggs to create a second layer. Lift the first roll up to get raw egg underneath. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top; roll second layer up over the first.",
