        "Season steaks with salt and pepper; allow steaks to come to room temperature, about 15 minutes.",
        "Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until very hot; lay steaks in pan and cook until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm plate; cover and let rest, about 10 minutes.",
