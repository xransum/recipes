        "In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  By hand, stir in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated.  Fold in nuts and bananas.",

        "Bake on center rack of oven for 45 minutes.  Marshmallows will rise to top and make a topping.  The cake may look slightly underbaked because of the marshmallow topping.  Allow the cake to cool before serving."
