        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush rimmed baking sheet with oil. Attach candy thermometer to side of heavy medium saucepan (do not allow tip to touch bottom). Add sugar and 1/4 cup water to saucepan and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until thermometer registers 240\u00b0F, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 4 minutes (time will vary depending on size of pan). Remove from heat. Quickly stir in chili powder, butter, chili sauce, and salt (mixture may bubble). Working quickly, add nuts; stir until coated. Transfer to baking sheet, spreading to separate nuts. Bake until nuts are browned and mixture bubbles, stirring occasionally, about 9 minutes. Cool. Break nuts apart. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store at room temperature in airtight container.)",
