        "Place the chocolate chips in a blender. Crack in the eggs, and then add the orange liqueur and salt. Pulse until the chocolate chips are partially pulverized, 5 to 7 times.",
        "With the blender running, carefully pour in the coffee in a steady stream through the small opening in the lid. The coffee will melt the chocolate and turn it into a smooth mixture. Turn off the blender when the mixture is very smooth. Pour the mixture into small mason jars, pretty wine glasses or demitasse cups.",
        "Place the jars on a tray and refrigerate them until firm, at least 2 or 3 hours. Yum!",
        "Whip the cream with the sugar and generously plop it onto the top of each glass. Cut a strip of orange peel, cut into strips and decorate with the orange peel twists."
