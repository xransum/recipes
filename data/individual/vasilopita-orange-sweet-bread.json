        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 round cake pans.",
        "Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Put 1 wrapped coin in each piece; knead for 2 to 3 minutes and shape into a ball. Place 1 ball of dough in each cake pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise until puffy, 2 to 4 hours more.",
        "Whisk egg white and vanilla together in a small bowl. Brush over the top of dough.",
