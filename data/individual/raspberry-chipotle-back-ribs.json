        "About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well.   Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate.",
        "Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.",
        "Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Spray both sides of ribs with tamarind juice.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.",
        "Continue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more until very tender, spraying with tamarind juice every 30 minutes.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.",
        "Move ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until sauce is set.  Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.",
        "Serve ribs with remaining sauce."
