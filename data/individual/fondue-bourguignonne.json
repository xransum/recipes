        "In a fondue pot over medium-high heat, warm the oil until it registers 375\u00baF on a deep-frying thermometer, or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil browns evenly in 20 to 30 seconds.",
        "Using pot holders, carefully place the fondue pot with the hot oil on the stand and keep warm according to the manufacturers instructions. Set the fondue pot on the table.",
        "For each guest, provide a plate of beef, a fondue fork, another plate for eating and a small dish to season the beef before cooking.",
        "Instruct each guest to skewer a piece of beef onto the fondue fork and then season the beef with salt and black pepper. Submerge the beef in the hot oil and cook just until the exterior is golden brown, about 1 minute for rare to medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes for medium to well-done. (Be sure to remove the beef from the hot fork before eating.) Serve the horseradish sauce alongside."
