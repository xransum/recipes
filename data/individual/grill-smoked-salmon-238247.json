    "directions": [
        "Build a fire in a smoker/grill for indirect heat. Maintain a temperature of about 300\u00b0F.",
        "Put each fish in an aluminum foil roasting pan, bending the short ends if necessary to lay the fish flat. Place the fish \"boats\" in the cooker on the side opposite the coals.",
        "Smoke the fish for about 35 minutes. (Smaller fish will take 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness.) The salmon is done when it is almost opaque throughout but still pink in the center. (If substituting white fish, cook until opaque throughout.)",
        "Remove the salmon from the smoker. Transfer to a cutting board and fillet or cut into steaks, or place on a large platter and carve at the table."
