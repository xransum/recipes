        "In a 2-quart heavy saucepan combine maple syrup, sugar, salt, and cream and cook mixture over moderately low heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to side with a brush dipped in cold water, until sugar is dissolved. Boil mixture over moderate heat, undisturbed, until thickened and a candy thermometer registers 220\u00b0F. Stir in butter and pecans, stirring until butter is melted, and cool sauce until warm. Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week. Serve sauce warm over ice cream."
