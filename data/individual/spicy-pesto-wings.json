        "For the pesto: Combine the basil, cheese, pine nuts, garlic and lemon juice in a food processor and pulse until a paste is formed. While the machine is running, slowly drizzle in 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the peppered canola oil until the desired consistency is achieved. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "For the wings: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil.",
        "Season the wings with salt and pepper, drizzle with the olive oil and mix to combine. Arrange the wings on the prepared baking sheet and roast until the skin is golden brown and the wings are cooked through, 18 to 25 minutes depending on size. Remove the wings from the oven, toss with the pesto sauce, put them back in the oven and cook until just warmed through. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and serve immediately."
