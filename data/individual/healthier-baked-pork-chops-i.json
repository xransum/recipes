Dip into beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place breaded pork into a 9x13-inch baking dish.; do not stack.",

Replace foil and bake until sauce is hot and bubbly and pork juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C)."
