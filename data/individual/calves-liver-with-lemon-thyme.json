        "Rinse liver and pat dry. Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Place the fresh thyme in a layer on the bottom of the pan, then lay the liver on top. Cook on medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Calves' liver may be eaten slightly pink, but be careful not to overcook it.  Season with salt and pepper after cooking."
