        "Lightly spray four 6-ounce (2/3-cup) souffl\u00e9 molds or ramekins with vegetable-oil cooking spray.",
        "In a small bowl stir together prunes, hot tea, lemon juice, and zest and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Remove 3 prunes from mixture and coarsely chop. In a food processor pur\u00e9e remaining prune mixture (including soaking liquid) until very smooth. Cool pur\u00e9e and stir in chopped prunes. Pur\u00e9e may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring pur\u00e9e to room temperature before proceeding.",
        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F.",
        "In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until foamy. Beat in cream of tartar and beat whites until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in granulated sugar and beat meringue until it just holds stiff peaks. Whisk about one fourth meringue into pur\u00e9e to lighten and fold in remaining meringue gently but thoroughly. Spoon mixture into molds or ramekins and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake souffl\u00e9s in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 16 minutes.",
        "Dust souffl\u00e9s with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately. At table, with 2 forks pull open top of each souffl\u00e9 and spoon 1 tablespoon frozen yogurt into each opening."
