        "In bowl of a standing electric mixer with paddle attachment sprinkle yeast over water with 1/4 teaspoon sugar and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add remaining sugar, flour, milk, salt, and yolks and beat on low speed until combined well. Beat in butter, a few pieces at a time, and beat on medium speed until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (Dough will be soft.) Scrape dough from side of bowl and let rise, covered with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.",

(Alternatively, buns may be made 1 week ahead: Bake buns in middle of oven until pale golden, about 15 minutes (buns will not be completely baked), and transfer pan to a rack to cool completely. Freeze buns in pan, covered tightly with foil. To serve, thaw buns at room temperature 1 hour and bake in a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven until golden, about 10 minutes). Transfer buns to a rack and cool slightly.",
