        "Heat vegetable oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until it registers 385 to 390\u00b0F on thermometer.",
        "While oil is heating, whisk together flour, salt, olive oil, water, and parsley in a bowl. Drain cod and pat dry, then cut into 3- by 1/2-inch strips. Working in batches of 4, coat strips in batter, then transfer to oil with tongs and fry, turning, until golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. (Return oil to 385 to 390\u00b0F between batches.)",
