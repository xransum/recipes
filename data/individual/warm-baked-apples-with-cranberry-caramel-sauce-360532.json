Stand apples in 11 x 7-inch glass baking dish, trimming apple bottoms if necessary to create flat surface.",

        "Transfer each apple to shallow bowl, emptying any juices from center into baking dish. Pour syrup from dish into medium saucepan. Boil syrup until thick enough to coat spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon over warm apples. Top each baked apple with whipped cream."
