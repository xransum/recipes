        "Tie the sprigs of parsley and thyme together with the bay leaves or place them in a cheesecloth and tie closed, because you will want to easily remove the herbs later. Place the herb bundle, lamb, ham, onion, tomato, garlic and stock in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.",
        "Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour. Stir in the beans and sausage and continue to simmer for about 15 minutes, or more if you want a thicker consistency."
