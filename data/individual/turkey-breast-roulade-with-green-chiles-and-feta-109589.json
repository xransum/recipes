        "Char chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened all over. Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes, then peel and seed. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.)",
        "Whisk oil, garlic, and cumin in small bowl to blend. Using small sharp knife, remove bones from 1 turkey breast; reserve bones. Place breast, skin side down, between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pound with mallet to 1/2-inch thickness (about 12x9-inch irregular rectangle). Remove top sheet of plastic. Brush turkey with 1/4 of oil mixture; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top evenly with half of flattened chiles. Sprinkle chiles with half of feta, then 2 tablespoons oregano. Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey breast jelly-roll style. Secure edge with skewers or toothpicks, then tie with kitchen twine. Repeat with remaining turkey breast, 1/4 of oil mixture, chiles, feta, and 2 tablespoons oregano. Oil two 13x9x2-inch metal baking pans. Transfer roulades to prepared pans, skewer side down. Brush roulades with remaining oil mixture. Add reserved bones to pans. Sprinkle rolls with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",

        "Remove roulades from oven; let stand at room temperature 5 minutes. Transfer roulades to cutting board; tent with foil. Place same baking pans over burners on high heat. Add 1 cup broth, 1/2 cup wine, and 1 tablespoon oregano to each pan; boil until liquid in each pan is reduced to 1 cup, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes. Discard bones. Season sauce with salt and pepper.",
