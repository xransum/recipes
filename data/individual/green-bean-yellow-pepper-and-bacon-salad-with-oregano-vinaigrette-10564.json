        "In a kettle of boiling water cook the beans for 2 to 4 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, drain them, and refresh them in a bowl of ice and cold water. In a large bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, and the or\u00e9gano and add the oil in a stream, whisking until the vinaigrette is emulsified. To the vinaigrette add the beans, drained well, the yellow pepper, and the bacon, crumbled, toss the salad, and season it with salt and black pepper. The salad may be made 8 hours in advance."
