        "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the ground lamb, and cook until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess grease, and set meat aside. Heat vegetable oil in the same skillet, and stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking 1 minute more.",
