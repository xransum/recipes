        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and generously grease two large loaf pans.  (The long pieces of pear make the loaves more susceptible to sticking in the pans and falling apart, so make sure you grease the pans generously.)",
        "In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, vegetable oil, molasses, and eggs.  Mix in salt, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and allspice.  Stir the pear slices in, coating them evenly.  Stir in the flour. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans",
        "Bake for 50 to 65 minutes.  Allow loaves to cool in pan about ten minutes before removing them and placing them on a wire rack to cool completely."
