        "Place sunflower seeds in jar and pour in cold water to cover. Seal jar and let seeds sit at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours.",
        "Drain sunflower seeds and return to jar. Cover with a double layer of cheesecloth, secure with a rubber band, and let seeds sit until just beginning to sprout, at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. Pat dry with paper towels.",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan fitted with thermometer over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Carefully add sunflower seeds and cook, swirling pan, until puffed and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Let cool.",
        "Cook chopped dill in a large saucepan of boiling salted water just until wilted and bright green, about 30 seconds. Immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water and swish around to cool as quickly as possible. Drain dill and gently squeeze to remove excess water.",
        "Blend dill, buttermilk, and milk in a blender until mixture is bright green and smooth. With motor running, gradually stream in 1/4 cup sunflower oil followed by guar gum, if using (guar gum will give the sauce body without impacting flavor; if omitting, sauce will be a bit runny but equally tasty); season with salt. Transfer dill sauce to a medium bowl. Cover and chill.",
        "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Lightly drizzle cut sides of romaine with more sunflower oil; season with salt. Grill, cut side down, until grill marks appear but lettuce is still very crunchy, about 45 seconds. (Or char in a grill pan over medium-high.) Transfer to a platter; let cool.",
        "Heat crabmeat, olive oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over low, stirring gently, until slightly warm; season with salt.",
        "Divide crab mixture among plates. Gently dip romaine in dill sauce and turn to coat completely, letting excess drip back into bowl. Arrange over crab; top with dill sprigs and fried sunflower seeds.",
        "Dill sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled."
