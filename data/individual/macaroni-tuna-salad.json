        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Transfer the macaroni to a bowl, and cool in the refrigerator.",
        "In a large bowl, lightly toss the tuna with celery, onion, and about 1 cup mayonnaise until combined, then stir in the remaining mayonnaise, macaroni, olives, and grape tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let the salad chill in refrigerator 1 hour."
