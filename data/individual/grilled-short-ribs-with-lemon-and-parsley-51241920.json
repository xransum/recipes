        "Season ribs generously with kosher salt and pepper. Place in a shallow baking dish with onion, orange juice, lime juice, oil, and 1/2 cup chopped parsley; toss to coat.",
        "Cover and chill at least 3 hours.",
        "Let ribs sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling.",
        "Prepare grill for 2-zone heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on 1 side of grill; for a gas grill, leave 1 or 2 burners off).",
        "Remove ribs from marinade, scraping off excess, and grill over direct heat, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, 15\u201320 minutes.",
        "Move ribs to indirect heat and grill, bone side down, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 130\u00b0 for medium-rare, 5\u201310 minutes (cooking past this point will yield tough meat). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.",
        "Cut meat from bone and slice thinly against the grain (this step is key for pleasantly chewy bites); season with sea salt and pepper. Serve topped with lemon zest and parsley leaves.",
        "Do ahead: Ribs can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep chilled."
