Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F, about 3 hours. Tilt turkey so juices from main cavity run into pan. Transfer turkey to platter. Tent very loosely with foil; let rest at least 30 minutes (internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees). Reserve pan.",
