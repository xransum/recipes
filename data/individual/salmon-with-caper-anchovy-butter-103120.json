        "Blend first 7 ingredients in food processor. Add butter and process until well blended. Season to taste with salt. Lay sheet of plastic wrap on work surface. Transfer butter mixture to plastic wrap and roll to form 9-inch-long log. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. (Caper-anchovy butter can be prepared 1 week ahead. Keep frozen. Let butter soften slightly before using.) Position oven rack about 6 inches below broiler; preheat broiler. Place salmon fillets on broiler pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil salmon until just cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to plates. Cut caper-anchovy butter into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Top each salmon fillet with 2 slices butter (reserve any remaining butter for another use). Serve salmon fillets hot."
