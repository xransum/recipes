        "Place the sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet, drizzle with 2 Tbs. of the olive oil and spread out in a single layer. Roast, stirring once, until the potatoes are caramelized and very tender, about 25 minutes. Let cool, transfer to a bowl and, using a potato masher or a fork, mash slightly.",

        "In a large fry pan over medium heat, warm 1/2 tsp. of the olive oil. Fry each quesadilla, turning once and adding 1/2 tsp. more olive oil for each, until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer the quesadillas to a cutting board and cut into quarters.",
        "Put the arugula in a bowl and drizzle with the remaining 2 Tbs. olive oil and the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Serve the quesadillas topped with the arugula. Serves 4.",
