        "In a large soup pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and stir in the lemon juice, garlic, carrots, onions, and celery. Cook and stir until the carrots become soft enough to break apart with a fork, about 20 minutes. Transfer the vegetables and their juices into a bowl, and refrigerate. Once slightly cool, place them into a blender, and blend until the mixture forms a smooth puree.",
        "Pour the water into the soup pot, and stir in the chicken bouillon cubes until they dissolve. Pour in the vegetable puree, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Stir in split peas, Italian seasoning, cumin, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and curry powder. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the peas soften and break down into a thick soup, at least 45 minutes."
