        "Position 1 rack in center and 1 rack in top third of oven and preheat to 300\u00b0F. Spray 2 heavy large baking sheets with nonstick vegetable oil spray. Finely grind hazelnuts in processor. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy. Add cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff and glossy but not dry. Beat in vanilla extract. Sift cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup of sugar into small bowl. Sift half of cornstarch mixture over meringue mixture. Using rubber spatula, carefully fold into meringue. Sift remaining half of cornstarch mixture over and fold into meringue. Gently fold in nuts.",
        "Working in batches, spoon meringue into large pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe meringue onto prepared baking sheets, forming 1-inch rounds and spacing 1/2 inch apart. Bake until meringues are light golden brown and set, about 35 minutes. Let meringues stand 5 minutes on baking sheets. Carefully transfer meringues to rack and cool completely. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store in air-tight containers at room temperature.)"
