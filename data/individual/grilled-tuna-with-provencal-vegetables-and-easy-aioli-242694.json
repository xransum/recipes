Remove from grill and cut into bite-size chunks. Place vegetables, tomatoes, herbes de Provence, and garlic in large bowl; toss to blend. Set aside. Grill tuna steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Place tuna on plates, top with vegetables, and serve with aioli. * A dried herb mixture; sold in the spice section of supermarkets and at specialty foods stores. If unavailable, a combination of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds can be substituted."
