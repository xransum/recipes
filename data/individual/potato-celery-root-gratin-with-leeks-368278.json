        "Butter a 3-quart gratin dish with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Layer 1/3 of potato slices and 1/3 of celery root slices evenly over bottom of baking dish. Cover with 1/3 of leeks, then 1/3 of Gruy\u00e8re. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon thyme leaves. Repeat layers twice more. Strain cream mixture into a medium pitcher and pour over vegetables.",
        "Set gratin dish on a large rimmed baking sheet and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 1 hour.

Tent with foil and rewarm in a 300\u00b0 oven until hot, about 20 minutes."
