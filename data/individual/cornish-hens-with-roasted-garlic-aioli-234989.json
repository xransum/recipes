        "Trim off and discard about 1/4 inch from top of garlic heads to expose cloves, then put heads on a sheet of foil. Spoon oil over garlic, then wrap up foil tightly to enclose. Roast garlic on oven rack until very soft, about 40 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, season hens inside and out with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Tie legs together with string and tuck wing tips under. Transfer to roasting pan and roast alongside garlic until hens are golden brown and thermometer registers 170\u00b0F when inserted into leg joint, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand, loosely covered with foil, 15 minutes.",

        "Halve hens lengthwise. Serve with aioli."
