        "About one hour before smoking, coat both sides of ribs with a little vegetable oil and sprinkle with barbecue seasoning rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.",
        "Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 230 to 250 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.",
        "Place the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.",
        "Remove ribs from grill. Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 3 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Remove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with Kansas City-style barbecue sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce."
