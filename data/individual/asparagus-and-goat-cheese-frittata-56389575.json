        "Set a medium rice cooker to the regular cycle or to quick cook if it's a fuzzy-logic machine. Heat the olive oil and saut\u00e9 the spring onion for 1 minute. Add the asparagus and cook for another 3 minutes, or until the asparagus begins to soften. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, salt, and Tabasco. Pour the egg mixture over the asparagus and sprinkle with the goat cheese.",
        "Cover the rice cooker and reset to the regular cycle. The frittata will take 3 to 4 minutes to cook. Allow it to continue steaming, covered, for an additional 6 minutes on the keep-warm setting or with the machine turned off. (Many rice cookers, including all fuzzy-logic machines, do this automatically.) Serve warm or at room temperature."
