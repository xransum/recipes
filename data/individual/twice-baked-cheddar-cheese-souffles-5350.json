        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Mix breadcrumbs and hazelnuts in small bowl. Butter four 8-ounce souffl\u00e9 dishes or custard cups. Coat sides and bottoms of dishes with breadcrumb mixture. Place dishes in large roasting pan.",
        "Bring milk to boil in heavy large saucepan. Set aside. Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir until pale golden, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Bring mixture to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup cheese and egg yolk. Cool slightly.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, lemon juice and pinch of salt in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Gently fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm cheese mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining whites.",
        "Divide half of souffl\u00e9 mixture among prepared dishes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cheese over each souffl\u00e9. Top with remaining souffl\u00e9 mixture. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come 1/2 inch up sides of dishes.",
        "Bake souffl\u00e9s until puffed and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove dishes from water. Cool 10 minutes. Run small knife around sides of souffl\u00e9s. Gently turn souffl\u00e9s out onto baking sheet. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool. Cover and refrigerate.)",
        "Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup cheese evenly over souffl\u00e9s. Bake until souffl\u00e9s are heated through, about 8 minutes if baked immediately or 10 minutes if refrigerated overnight. Transfer to plates."
