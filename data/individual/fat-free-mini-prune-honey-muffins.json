        "In a food processor, combine the prunes and water. Process for a moment to chop the prunes. Add the flour to the food processor, and mix until it reaches a bread crumb consistency, about 10 seconds. Pour in the honey, and mix until just blended. Spoon the gooey mixture into the prepared muffin cups. One teaspoon per muffin ensures easy removal.",
