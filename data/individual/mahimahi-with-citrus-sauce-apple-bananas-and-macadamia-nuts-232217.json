        "To prepare the sauce, in a saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil over high heat, decrease the heat to medium, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sauce becomes syrupy. Add the honey, orange zest, lemon zest, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, syrup, and canola oil. Continue to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sauce is syrupy and reduced by one third. Pass through a fine-meshed sieve and keep warm.",
        "Split the bananas in half lengthwise. Combine the shichimi and coconut flakes in a shallow bowl. Coat the cut side of each banana piece with the coconut mixture. Place a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the bananas, coconut side down. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute, or until lightly browned. Remove from the heat and keep warm.",
        "Season the mahimahi with salt. Place a saut\u00e9w pan over high heat and add the oil. Then the oil is hot, add the mahimahi. Cook for 2 minutes or until browned. Turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes, or until the flesh flakes with slight pressure with a fork.",
        "To serve, divide the greens among 4 plates. Place the mahimahi on top of the greens and the banana on top of the mahimahi. Drizzle 3 to 4 tablespoons of the sauce around each serving. Garnish with the cucumber and macadamia nuts. Serve immediately."
