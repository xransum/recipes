        "Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground. Using on/off turns, cut in butter until pea-size pieces form. Add yolk, 1 teaspoon water, and extract; using on/off turns, blend just until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 3 hours.",
        "Roll out dough between 2 lightly floured sheets of waxed paper to 1/4-inch thickness. Peel off top sheet of paper. Invert crust into 11-inch round tart pan with removable bottom. Peel off paper; press dough into pan. Trim edges. Push crust 1/8 inch above top edge of pan. Refrigerate 1 hour.",

        "Combine milk and cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Whisk yolks, sugar, and cornstarch in large bowl to blend.
