        "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in Arborio rice until well coated in oil; continue cooking until both the onion and rice begin to turn golden-brown, about 8 minutes.",
        "Pour in the white wine and stir until evaporated. Pour in 1/3 of the hot chicken broth; stir constantly as the risotto simmers and slowly absorbs the broth, about 8 minutes. Add half of the remaining broth, and continue stirring until absorbed, about another 8 minutes.",
        "Stir in chile-garlic butter, shrimp, carrot, pine nuts, black olives, and red chile pepper until the butter has melted. Stir in the remaining chicken broth, and again stir constantly until absorbed, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with black pepper.",
        "At this point, taste the rice; it should be slightly firm and totally delicious. If it is still a little crunchy, stir in some hot water and continue cooking until it reaches the desired tenderness."
