        "Generously season the brisket with salt and pepper.",
        "In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil until just smoking. Add the garlic, tomato paste, paprika, cinnamon, demi-glace, dried bay leaf and thyme and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the wine and boil for 5 minutes. Add the stock, honey, the 2 tsp. salt and the 1/4 tsp. pepper and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.",
        "Place the brisket in a vacuum-sealable bag and pour in the stock mixture. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; be sure you have a smooth, airtight seal. Carefully place the bag into the circulating water and cook for 72 hours.",

        "In an essential pan or a large, deep saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Add the brisket and sear, turning once, until well browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a carving board. Pour off the excess fat from the pan, add the sauce and set over high heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally and skimming as needed, until the sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes, adding the onions and carrots during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.",
        "Cut the brisket across the grain into slices. Transfer to a large platter and spoon the vegetables over and around the meat. Drizzle some of the sauce over the meat and pour the rest into a bowl. Garnish the platter with fresh bay leaves. Serve immediately and pass the sauce at the table. Serves 10.",
