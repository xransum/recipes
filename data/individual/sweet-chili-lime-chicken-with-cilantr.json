        "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast cubes in the hot oil until the juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink inside, 5 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle chicken with monosodium glutamate as it cooks. Remove chicken from skillet.",
        "Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, lime juice, and lime zest in a bowl, stirring to dissolve sugar. Pour sauce into hot skillet, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low.

Mix cooked chicken into sauce and cook until sauce forms a glaze on chicken pieces, about 2 to 3 more minutes, stirring often.",

        "Arrange couscous onto a serving platter, top with chicken and sauce, and serve with lime wedges. Squeeze lime wedges over couscous and chicken before serving."
