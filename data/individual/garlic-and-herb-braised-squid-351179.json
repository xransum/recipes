        "Rinse squid under cold water and pat dry. Halve any large tentacles lengthwise and cut bodies (including flaps, if attached) crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide rings.",
        "Chop enough parsley to measure 2 tablespoons and reserve. Chop remaining parsley and garlic together. Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over low heat until hot, then cook parsley-garlic mixture and red-pepper flakes, stirring, until garlic begins to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add squid, then cook, stirring occasionally, until squid is barely opaque, about 1 minute. Add wine and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juice, water, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until squid is very tender, 30 to 40 minutes.",
        "Season with additional salt and pepper and stir in reserved parsley."
