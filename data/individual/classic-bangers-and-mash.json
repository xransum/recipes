Cook, turning often, until golden brown and juices run clear, 12 to 15  minutes depending on thickness. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.",

        "To serve, scoop the potatoes onto a large serving plate. Arrange the sausages over the potatoes, top with the onions, drizzle with gravy, and sprinkle with oregano."
