        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. and butter eight 1/2-cup ramekins.",
        "Into a large bowl coarsely grate corn. With back of a large knife, gently scrape each cob and add any remaining pulp and liquid to bowl. (There should be about 2 cups grated corn with liquid.)",
        "In a bowl whisk together remaining ingredients and stir into corn until combined well. Ladle mixture evenly into ramekins. Put ramekins in a baking pan just large enough to hold them and add enough hot water to reach halfway up sides of ramekins.",
        "Bake corn puddings in middle of oven 50 minutes, or until tops are slightly puffed and golden and firm to the touch. Remove ramekins from water and cool slightly on a rack, about 5 minutes. Run a knife around edges of ramekins and invert each pudding onto a serving plate."
