        "Bake sweet potato in a 375\u00b0F. oven until tender, about 1 hour. Cut thin slice from the top of each potato, lengthwise, and carefully scoop out the insides. Mash. Saut\u00e9 mushrooms in 4 tablespoons butter. Add to potatoes. Add remaining ingredients except butter. Mix well. Stuff potato skins with the mixture. Dot with remaining butter. Bake in 375\u00b0F. oven until brown--about 20 minutes. (This may be baked in a greased casserole instead of the potato skins if desired.)"
