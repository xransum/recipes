        "Preheat an oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush a baking sheet with olive oil and arrange the baguette slices on the sheet in a single layer. Brush the tops with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Bake until crisp and golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature and store the crostini in an airtight container at room temperature until ready to use.",
        "On a clean work surface, dice the steak into 1/4-inch pieces. Transfer to a mixing bowl and refrigerate.",
        "In another mixing bowl, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper, and whisk to blend. Add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until smooth and blended.",
        "Add the dressing to the steak along with the parsley, olives, capers and green onion. Toss gently to mix, and season with salt and pepper. On a chilled serving platter, spoon half of the steak tartare into a small mound, arrange the crostini alongside the tartare and serve; keep the remaining steak tartare refrigerated and replenish as needed."
