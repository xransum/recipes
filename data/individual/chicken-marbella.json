        "Rub the rosemary-lemon mixture underneath the skin of the chicken breast halves, and place chicken into a large Dutch oven. Arrange potatoes, carrots, onion, mushrooms, tomato, prunes, and olives around the chicken. Pour the white wine and chicken broth over the chicken and vegetables.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring chicken and vegetables with pan juices after 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast and not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
