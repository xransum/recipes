        "Pound the pork chops with a spiked meat mallet until 1/4 inch thick; set aside.  In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper.  Press the pork into the crumbs to bread thoroughly; set aside.",
        "Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Pour in the wine and sliced mushrooms.  Allow to simmer and cook until the mushrooms have softened, about 10 minutes.  Stir together the cornstarch and water, then add to the mushroom sauce.  Simmer until the sauce has thickened, then remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry the pork cutlets a few at a time until golden brown and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.  Serve with reserved mushroom sauce."
