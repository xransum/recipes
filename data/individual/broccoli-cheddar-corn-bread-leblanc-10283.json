        "In a large saucepan of boiling salted water blanch the broccoli for 2 minutes, drain it well, and pat it dry between several thicknesses of paper towels. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, and salt and pepper to taste, add the eggs, and whisk the mixture until it is just combined. (The batter will be very thick.) Stir in the onion, the broccoli, and the Cheddar. In a 9-inch square baking pan heat the butter in a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven until it is hot but not smoking, spoon the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly, and bake the corn bread in the middle of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tester comes out clean. Serve the corn bread as an accompaniment to soup."
