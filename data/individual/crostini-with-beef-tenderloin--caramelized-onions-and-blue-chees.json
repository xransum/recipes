        "In a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the onion and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized, about 20 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl and wipe out the pan.",

Sear the meat on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for rare, 5 to 7 minutes, or until done to your liking. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes, then slice very thinly against the grain.",

        "To assemble, spread 2 tsp. of the blue cheese mixture on each baguette slice. Top with 1 tsp. caramelized onions and top with a slice of steak. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and garnish with herb leaves. Serves 6 to 8.",
