        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Cook onion in 3 tablespoons oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened. Add pork and saut\u00e9 over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir together tomato paste and water and stir into pork. Simmer until most of tomato paste is absorbed, about 2 minutes, then add tomatoes, sugar, cinnamon, pepper, and 1 tablespoon sea salt. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 4 cups, about 30 minutes.",
        "While pork rag\u00f9 simmers, bring 6 quarts water to a boil with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 2 tablespoons sea salt in an 8-quart pot for rigatoni. Toast almonds in a shallow baking pan in middle of oven until fragrant and a few shades darker, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately sprinkle nuts with extract, tossing. Cool and coarsely chop.",

Spread a thin coating of rag\u2039 in bottom of a lightly oiled 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish, then spread half of rigatoni over it.
