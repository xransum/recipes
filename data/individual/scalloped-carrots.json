        "Melt 1/3 cup butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt. Whisk flour into onion mixture until smooth; cook, stirring constantly, until flour mixture is a paste-like consistency and light brown, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Increase heat to medium; gradually stream milk into flour mixture until thick and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk Cheddar cheese, about 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring until cheese melts each time before adding more, forming a smooth sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in mustard powder, white pepper, celery seed, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over carrots and toss to coat; transfer to the prepared casserole dish.",
        "Mix 2 tablespoons melted butter and bread crumbs together in a bowl until well coated; sprinkle over carrot mixture.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and topping is browned, 25 to 30 minutes."
