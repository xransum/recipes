        "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion and celery until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables into a large bowl. Mix in the stuffing mix, oysters, melted butter, and seasoning; pour in hot water to desired moistness. If used for stuffing a turkey, stuffing will need less moisture."
