        "Mix garlic and lime juice; set aside 3 Tbs. of mixture for a post-grill marinade. For dressing, add a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the remaining lime juice mixture and slowly whisk in oil; set aside.",
        "Mix cumin, salt and pepper in a small dish. Rub steaks on both sides with oil, and season with cumin mixture. Brush peppers with oil, then season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine onion with vinegar and a pinch of salt. Set all aside.",
        "Build a fire on only one side of grill (to conserve charcoal). When coals are covered with white ash, place steak and peppers on rack over direct heat, cover and grill until steaks are well seared, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium to medium-rare meat.",
        "Transfer steaks to plate and immediately drizzle with reserved lime mixture. Transfer peppers to a cutting board, and cut each quarter in thirds to get 24 pieces of pepper. Let sit 5 minutes or up to 1 hour. Thinly slice steak across grain. Toss greens with dressing. Arrange in six shallow bowls. Top with steak, peppers, pickled onions and a dollop of sour cream."
