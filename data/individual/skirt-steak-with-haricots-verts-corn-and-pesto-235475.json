        "Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 corn, stirring, until just starting to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.",
        "Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and saut\u00e9 steaks, in batches if necessary, turning over once, 3 to 5 minutes per batch for thin pieces and 5 to 7 minutes per batch for thicker pieces (for medium-rare). Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before slicing.",
        "While steaks rest, cook haricots verts in a large pot of well-salted boiling water, uncovered, until just tender, about 4 minutes, and drain well in a colander. Add beans to corn then add pesto, stirring to coat. Serve corn and beans topped with sliced steak."
