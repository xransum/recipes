Using the bottom of a 1/2-cup (125-ml) dry measuring cup, press the crumbs evenly and firmly into the bottom of the pan and up the fluted sides. Place a piece of parchment paper over the crust and add pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and bake for 5 minutes more. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.",

If using a tart pan with a removable bottom, let the sides fall away, then slide the tart onto a serving plate. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving. Top with whipped cream and lemon zest, cut into slices and serve. Serves 8.",
