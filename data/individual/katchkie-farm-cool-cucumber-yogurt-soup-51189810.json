        "Combine all the ingredients except the radishes in a food processor. Puree until smooth, then strain through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Refrigerate the soup until it is well chilled, about 2 hours or up to a day before serving. Thin the soup with just a small amount of water if it is thicker than you like. Ladle the soup into bowls, top with the radishes, and serve."
