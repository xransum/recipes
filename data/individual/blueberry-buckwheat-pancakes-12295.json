        "In a food processor blend together the flours, the baking powder, the sugar, and the salt, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles fine meal. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs and the milk, add the flour mixture, and whisk the batter until it is combined well. Let the batter stand for 5 minutes and stir in the blueberries.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with the oil. Spoon the batter onto the griddle to form 3-inch rounds and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden. Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in the oven. Serve the pancakes with the syrup."
