        "In a shallow dish roll the ice-cream balls in the coconut, coating them heavily, and freeze the snowballs while making the mocha sauce. In a small heavy saucepan combine the brown sugar, the corn syrup, and the espresso powder, bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat, stirring, and cook it, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chocolate, the cream, the Kahl\u00fba, and a pinch of salt, and stir the sauce until it is smooth. Pour some of the mocha sauce onto each of 2 plates, divide the snowballs between the plates, and serve the remaining sauce separately."
