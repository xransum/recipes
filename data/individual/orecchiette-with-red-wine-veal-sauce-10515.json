        "In a blender or food processor coarsely pur\u00e9e tomatoes with juice and stir into onions with remaining sauce ingredients. Bring mixture to a simmer. Add shanks and cook, covered, over low heat 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until meat is tender. Discard cloves.",
        "Transfer shanks to a cutting board and cool slightly. Simmer sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.",
        "Using 2 forks shred meat. With a sharp knife remove marrow from shanks and chop. Stir meat and marrow into sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer sauce 15 minutes. Sauce may be made ahead, cooled completely, uncovered, and chilled, covered. 2 days or frozen 1 month.",
