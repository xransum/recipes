        "In a food processor grind the fruitcake until it forms a ball, scoop up rounded teaspoons of it, and with dampened hands form them into balls. Let the balls stand, uncovered, in a jelly-roll pan lined with wax paper for 30 minutes. In a small metal bowl set in a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the chocolate, stirring until it is smooth, and remove the bowl from the pan. Balancing the fruitcake balls, 1 at a time, on the tines of a fork, dip them into the chocolate, letting the excess drip off, and transfer them to the wax paper, reserving the remaining chocolate for another use. Chill the balls for 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is hardened. The fruitcake balls keep, covered and chilled, for 1 week."
