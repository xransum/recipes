        "Poach scallops in red wine to cover, seasoned with salt, thyme, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon chopped shallot, and 1 chopped clove garlic. The scallops will cook very quickly, in a little more than a minute. Do not let them shrink and get tough but scoop them out the minute they are done and arrange them in buttered individual ramekins or shells. Make beurre l'escargot by creaming the butter with the rest of the garlic, 3 finely chopped shallots, and 5 to 6 tablespoons chopped parsley. Top each ramekin of scallops with a good spoonful of the butter and sprinkle with almonds or sesame seeds. Put under broiler flame just long enough to brown well on top. Serve as first course at dinner or a main course at luncheon. With this, drink the same red wine used cooking, perhaps a Fleurie."
