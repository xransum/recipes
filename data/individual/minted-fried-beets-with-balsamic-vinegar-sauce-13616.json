        "In a large saucepan cover beets with salted water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until tender, about 35 mintues. Drain beets in a colander and cool until they can be handled. Slip off and discard skins and stems. Beets may be prepared up to this point 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.",
        "In a very small saucepan simmer sauce ingredients, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Remove pan from heat and let sauce stand, covered, 15 minutes. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a small bowl and cool. Sauce may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before serving.",
        "In a bowl whisk together flour, mint, and salt and add water, whisking until combined (batter will be lumpy).",
        "Cut beets into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a deep 9-inch skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until 375\u00b0F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Working in batches, dip beet slices in batter and fry, without crowding, until golden and crisp, about 1 minute on each side, making sure oil returns to 375\u00b0F. before adding next batch. Transfer beets as fried to paper towels and drain. Beets may be made 2 hours ahead and reheated on a baking sheet in a 425\u00b0F. oven 10 minutes.",
        "Serve beets with sauce on the side for dipping."
