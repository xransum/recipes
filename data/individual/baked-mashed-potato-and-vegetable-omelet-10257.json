        "In a 12-inch non-stick skillet cook the bell peppers, the onion, and the mushrooms with salt and black pepper to taste in 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and all the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, the potatoes, the Parmesan, the parsley, and salt and black pepper to taste until the mixture is combined well and stir in the vegetable mixture. In the skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, pour in the egg mixture, and bake the omelet in the middle of a preheated 325\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it is set. (If the skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.) Cut the omelet into wedges and serve it warm."
