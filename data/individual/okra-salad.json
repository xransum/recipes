        "Place bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until evenly browned, then remove to paper towels to drain. Pour off most of the bacon grease, leaving a thin coating on the pan. Add okra to the bacon grease in the skillet, and fry until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the okra to a salad bowl, and toss with the onion, green pepper, and tomato. Crumble in the bacon.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, corn oil, and vinegar until the sugar has dissolved. Pour over the salad, and toss to coat. Chill for 30 minutes before serving."
