Add the garlic, salsa, chili powder, pepper, garlic salt, and cumin; cook and stir until the garlic has mellowed, about 4 minutes. Place a tortilla onto a microwave-safe plate and top with the sausage mixture. Sprinkle with the shredded Monterey Jack cheese.",

Sprinkle the tortilla chips on top of the melted cheese and top with the remaining tortilla. Butter both sides of the quesadilla and place in a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook until golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, about 4 minutes per side."
