        "In a shallow 6-inch saucepan, thoroughly mix brown sugar and flour. Stir in butter and milk, and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Boil exactly 1-1/2 minutes.",
        "Remove from heat.  Allow to cool 5 minutes. Beat with a wooden spoon until mixture begins to thicken. Mix in vanilla and continue beating until frosting is the consistency of thick honey, no more than 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Immediately pour caramel frosting onto cooled cake and quickly spread with the back of a warm spoon before frosting begins to set up. Quickly sprinkle top of cake with toasted pecans. Frosting will set up completely in a few hours."
