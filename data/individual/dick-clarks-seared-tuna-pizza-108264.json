        "Pour 3/4 cup warm water into large bowl; mix in yeast. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Mix in oil and salt. Add 2 cups flour. Using rubber spatula, stir until dough forms. Knead in bowl until smooth and elastic, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky, about 6 minutes. Transfer dough to oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until dough is doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.",
