        "In a large bowl proof the yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water for 5 minutes, or until it is foamy. Add 1 cup of the flour, the cottage cheese, the egg, the dill, the dill seeds, the walnuts, the zest, and the salt and beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until it is combined well. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and beat the mixture with the spoon until it is combined well. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for 8 to 10 minutes, incorporating enough of the remaining 3/4 cup flour, if necessary, to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk.",
        "Stir down the dough, halve it, and on a lightly floured surface roll each half into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut each rope into 24 pieces with a sharp knife and form the pieces into balls. Put 3 balls of dough into each of 16 buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins, brush them with the melted butter, and let the rolls rise, uncovered, in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are almost double in bulk. Bake the rolls in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden. The rolls may be made 1 week in advance and kept wrapped tightly and frozen. Reheat the rolls, wrapped in foil, in a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are heated through."
