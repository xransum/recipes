        "In a dry small skillet cook the cuminseed over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is fragrant and several shades darker, being careful not to let it burn, and transfer it to a sheet of wax paper. Let the cuminseed cool, fold the wax paper over it, and with a rolling pin crush it to a coarse powder.",
        "In a heavy saucepan cook the onion in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened. Add the cauliflower, the broth, and the water and simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender. In a blender or food processor pur\u00e9e the mixture in batches, return it to pan, and stir in the half-and-half, the lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat the soup over low heat, stirring, until it is hot, but do not let it boil, ladle it into bowls, and sprinkle it with the cuminseed powder to taste."
