        "Stir together the mayonnaise, soy sauce, mirin, minced garlic, dried minced onion, onion powder, curry powder, turmeric, basil, cayenne pepper, and salt in a bowl. Fold in the bread crumbs until evenly moistened. Cover, and refrigerate at least an hour.",
        "Cut each shrimp along the back and open the halves like a book. Place a hearty dollop of the mayonnaise mixture onto each shrimp, and spread over the top to completely cover. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Place the shrimp in the pan, mayonnaise-side up, and add the water. Cover, and steam until the shrimp are no longer transparent, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes."
