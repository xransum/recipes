        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.",
        "Place turkey and stuffing in food processor, and pulse until finely ground and combined.  Place the ground turkey and stuffing mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer along with the cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and 2 cups of the mozzarella.  Mix with paddle attachment on medium-low until well blended.",

        "Bake, covered, for 45 minutes.  Uncover and cook for an additional 10 minutes until top is browned and bubbly.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving."
