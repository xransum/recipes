        "Season the beef with salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned but not crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate.",
        "Pour off all but 1 Tbs. of the fat from the pot. Working in batches, add the beef and brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Return all the beef to the pot and add the braising base and bacon. Stir in the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the pot bottom. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours.",
        "Add the onions and carrots to the pot and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the meat is fork-tender, about 1 hour more.",
        "About 30 minutes before the beef is done cooking, using a steamer pot, steam the potatoes until tender when pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the butter and 1 Tbs. of the parsley and toss to combine. Season with salt.",
        "Skim the fat off the sauce in the pot. Transfer the beef bourguignonne to shallow bowls and garnish with the remaining 1 Tbs. parsley and the thyme leaves. Serve immediately with the steamed potatoes. Serves 6.",
