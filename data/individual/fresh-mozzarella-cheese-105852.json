        "Place mozzarella curd in a large bowl. Pour boiling water over curd, gently folding it into itself as it begins to melt. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the curd begins to pull (you should have a stringlike effect). Work quickly with the curd to achieve a consistent silken texture. When curd comes together in a single mass, soak hands in ice water to chill for about ten seconds. When hands are cold, reach into salted hot water bath and lift curd from bowl. Return hands to ice bath as needed, as the cheese will be hot when handling. Knead cheese for a few seconds until smooth. Take the cheese in your hands and begin to fold it under itself, creating the desired size and shape. Place fresh mozzarella in a bowl of cool water; continue this process until all the fresh mozzarella is formed. Cheese may also be stored in cold water in the refrigerator for later use."
