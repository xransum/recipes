        "In a kettle cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until they are softened, add the wine, and boil the mixture for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes with the juice, 1 tablespoon of the parsley, the basil, the oregano, the salt, and the red pepper flakes and boil the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until it is thickened. Add the shrimp and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are just firm.",
        "In a large kettle of boiling salted water cook the rigatoni until it is just al dente, drain it well, and stir it into the shrimp mixture. Stir in 5 ounces of the Feta and salt and pepper to taste, transfer the mixture to a lightly oiled 4-quart shallow glass baking dish, and sprinkle the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and the remaining 2 ounces Feta. Bake the pasta in the middle of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 20 minutes, or until the Feta is bubbling and the top is slightly crusty."
