        "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, the sugar, the salt, and the cayenne, blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal, and stir in 3/4 cup of the Cheddar. In a small bowl stir together the egg yolk and the milk, add the mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the mixture with a fork until it just forms a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead it gently 8 to 10 times, and pat it into a 6-inch round. Cut the round with a sharp knife into 6 equal wedges, arrange the scones about 2 inches apart on a lightly greased baking sheet, and brush the tops lightly with some of the egg white, beaten lightly. Sprinkle each scone with about 1 teaspoon of the remaining Cheddar and bake the scones in the middle of the oven for 15 to 17 minutes, or until they are golden and cooked through."
