        "Place the sausages in a small skillet over medium heat, and fry them until very dark brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Finely chop the sausages, and set aside. In the same skillet, melt butter, and stir in 3 tablespoons of flour. Cook the butter-flour mixture until it turns a pale beige color, about 1 minute, then stir in the sausage, cream, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over the fried steaks."
