        "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).",
        "Place the rack of beef ribs in front of you on a work surface with the shiny white membrane facing up. Slip the blade of a sharp knife under the membrane at one end, and slice the membrane off the meat in a single piece, if possible. Discard the chewy membrane. Rub the ribs thoroughly with sea salt, front and back. Place the ribs onto a cooking rack in a roasting pan.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, about 6 hours. Lightly baste the beef with water (use beef broth if you prefer) after the first 1 1/2 hours, being careful not to dislodge the salt. Baste again every 45 minutes to 1 hour; after 6 hours of total cooking time, remove from oven and allow to rest 10 to 15 minutes before slicing up into servings."
