        "Mix egg, bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to the bowl; mix well with your hands until beef is evenly moistened. Shape the beef mixture into four patties.",
        "Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until completely browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; remove to a platter and drain grease from skillet.",
        "Return skillet to medium heat. Stir tomato sauce, green onions, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and yellow mustard together in the skillet. Gently lie the patties into the sauce; bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the patties are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
