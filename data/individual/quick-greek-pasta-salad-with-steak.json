        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente.  When cooked, drain, then toss with olive oil, and keep warm.",
        "Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Sear the rib-eye on both sides until rosy-pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes depending on thickness.  Remove steak from skillet and cut into bite-size pieces. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet, and stir in the garlic and shallots.  Cook 5 to 10 seconds until fragrant, then return the steak to the pan and cook for another 5 minutes or to desired doneness.  Stir in the soy sauce, and cook a few seconds longer, allowing it to evaporate.",
        "Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sun-dried tomato pesto, olives, spinach, basil, parsley, feta cheese and sunflower kernels.  Toss with the pasta in a large bowl and serve."
