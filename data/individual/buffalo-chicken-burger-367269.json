        "In a microwave-safe bowl, combine carrot slices with 2 tablespoons water; microwave on high, stirring every minute, until very tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and let cool; mash carrots. Add chicken, egg whites, celery, breadcrumbs and cheese; mix to combine. Form chicken mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. In a second bowl, stir cornstarch into hot sauce until dissolved; set aside. Coat a grill rack or grill pan with cooking spray. Grill patties over medium-high heat for 6 minutes; flip and grill 4 minutes more. Brush patties with hot sauce mixture; grill until internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F, about 2 minutes. Place 1 burger on bottom of each roll. Garnish with cheese and lettuce, if desired. Top with other half of roll. Serve with carrot and celery sticks and blue cheese dressing for dipping, if desired."
