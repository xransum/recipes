        "Trim the end of each radish half so that the half will stand upright and with a small melon-ball cutter hollow out the radishes. The radishes may be hollowed out 8 hours in advance and kept chilled in a bowl of water. Drain the radish shells, inverted, on paper towels for 5 minutes. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream cheese on high speed for 5 minutes, or until it is very light and fluffy, beat in the zest, the lemon juice, the dill, and salt and pepper to taste, and fold in the salmon roe. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and pipe it into the radish shells."
