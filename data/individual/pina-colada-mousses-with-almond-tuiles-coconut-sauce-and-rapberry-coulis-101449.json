        "In a small heavy saucepan stir together juice and sugar and simmer until reduced to about 3/4 cup. In a bowl lightly beat yolks and in a slow stream add half of hot juice mixture, whisking. Add egg mixture to remaining juice mixture and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thickened and a thermometer registers 160\u00b0F.",
        "Transfer custard to a clean bowl and with an electic mixer beat until cool and very thick. In another bowl with electric mixer beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks. Gently fold in coconut milk and fold cream mixture into custard gently but thoroughly. Spoon mousse into ten 1/3-cup cone-shaped paper cups or other very small paper cups. (If using cone-shaped paper cups, set in small winglass or juice glass to keep upright.) Freeze mousses, covered, at least 4 hours, or until firm, and up to 1 day.",
