        "Cook onion and jalape\u00f1os over a gas burner, turning often, until charred and beginning to soften, about 4 minutes (alternatively, cook in a hot dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron).

Move to cooler side of grill and continue to grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Serve pork topped with salsa.",
