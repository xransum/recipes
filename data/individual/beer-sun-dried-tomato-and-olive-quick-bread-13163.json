        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. and grease and flour a loaf pan, 9 by 5 by 3 inches. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, the salt, the baking soda, and the baking powder, add the egg, the beer, the tomatoes with the reserved oil, and the olives, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Turn the batter into the pan and bake the bread in the middle of the oven for 40 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Turn the bread out onto a rack and let it cool."
