        "Combine strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries with sugar and cardamom in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring regularly, for 5-7 minutes, until berries are soft but not falling apart. Remove from heat and stir in coconut milk. Carefully pour warm berry mixture into a pitcher. Pour mix into molds, helping some of the berries along with a spoon so they're evenly distributed. Freeze at least 4 hours (insert sticks when partially frozen) and up to 1 month."
