        "Pulse oats in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add flour, baking powder and soda, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, then pulse to mix well. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk and pulse until dough just forms a ball. Divide dough into quarters and cover with a kitchen towel.",

        "Roll out 1 piece of dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 10 1/2- by 8 1/2-inch rectangle. Brush lightly with beaten egg and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon anise seeds. Gently roll pin lightly over seeds to help them adhere.",
        "Trim dough (to a 10- by 8-inch rectangle) with a fluted pastry wheel or sharp knife. Cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into sixths for a total of 12 strips (4 by 1 2/3 inches). Arrange strips 1/2inch apart on a buttered baking sheet and make more in same manner, using another buttered baking sheet for last 2 batches.",
