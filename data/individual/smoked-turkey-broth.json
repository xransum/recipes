        "Pour 7 quarts water into a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the roasted turkey and vegetables, the garlic, and black peppercorns to the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer.",
        "Place the roasting pan over a stove burner (two burners, if it will fit) and heat until the drippings sizzle. Pour in 1 cup of water and scrape up and dissolve all the browned flavor bits from the roasting pan into the water. Pour the drippings mixture into the stock.",
        "Simmer for 6 hours, periodically skimming and discarding the foamy scum that forms on the top of the broth. Pour the stock through a strainer, discarding the turkey and vegetables (they have given up all their flavor). Cool and store in airtight containers. Can be frozen."
