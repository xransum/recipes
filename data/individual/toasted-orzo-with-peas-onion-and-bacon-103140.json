Saut\u00e9 until bacon browns and onion is tender, about 15 minutes. Add 3 1/4 cups broth and orzo and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until broth is absorbed and orzo is tender, about 18 minutes. Mix in peas. Add more broth if mixture is dry. Cover and cook until peas are just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve."
