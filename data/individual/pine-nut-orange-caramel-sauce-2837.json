        "Cook sugar and orange juice in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep golden brown, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 15 minutes; mixture will be foamy. Add cream and butter (mixture will bubble) and whisk until smooth. Whisk over medium heat until mixture thickens slightly and is deep caramel color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in sour cream. Stir in pine nuts. Let cool 5 minutes. Mix in orange peel. Cool until just warm. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)"
