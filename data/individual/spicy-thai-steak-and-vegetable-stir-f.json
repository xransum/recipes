Cook until the noodles are tender, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Whisk the beef broth, peanut sauce, soy sauce, and ground ginger together in a bowl; set aside.",

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet. Stir in the carrot, celery, green onion, and bell pepper. Cook and stir until the vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage, bean sprouts, and mushrooms. Stir in the sauce. Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes.",
