        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.",
        "Mix all the ingredients, by hand or mixer, until a well-blended, cohesive dough forms; this will take about 2 minutes at medium-low speed in a stand mixer.",
        "Drop the cookie dough by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet (a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here), leaving 1 inch between them; these cookies won't spread much when they bake.",
        "Use a fork to flatten each cookie to about 1/4 inch thick, making a cross-hatch design.",
        "Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes, until just browned on the bottom. Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet."
