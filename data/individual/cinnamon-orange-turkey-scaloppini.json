        "Combine the cinnamon, and garlic with a little salt and pepper; rub over both sides of the turkey cutlets.",
        "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned cutlets, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until nicely browned on the outside, but not fully cooked. Remove from the pan and set aside; keep warm.",
        "Pour the orange juice and lemon juice into the pan, stirring in any bits of food that are stuck to the pan. Bring to a boil, and return the turkey to the pan. Reduce heat to medium, and cook until liquid has reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve cutlets with sauce spooned over."
