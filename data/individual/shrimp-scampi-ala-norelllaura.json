Dredge the shrimp in the flour to coat, then shake off the excess. Raise heat to medium-high and stir in the shrimp and tomato; cook until the shrimp is pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice, wine, and butter; continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes more. Garnish with parsley to serve."
