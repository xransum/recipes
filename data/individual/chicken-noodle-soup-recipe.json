        "Add chicken and egg noodles to broth, cover and cook until the noodles are tender. Fish out garlic clove and divide soup into two batches; serve one plain to the kids. Heat the other half and whisk in 1/2 cup or so (more or less, according to taste) of the coconut peanut sauce. Season to taste and the whole family is happy."
