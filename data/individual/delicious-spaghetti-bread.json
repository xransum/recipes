        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer ground beef to a mixing bowl.",
        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Transfer spaghetti to bowl with ground beef and mix in spaghetti sauce and Parmesan cheese.",
        "Unroll pizza dough onto a baking sheet. Starting with a long edge, cut the 2 outer thirds of the crust into 1-inch horizontal strips, leaving the center third uncut. Spoon spaghetti mixture onto the center third from top to bottom. Spread mozzarella cheese over the spaghetti mixture.",
        "Braid the dough strips over the filling by pulling a dough strip across the filling and pulling another strip from the opposite side over the first strip. Pinch strips together and continue to braid until the filling is covered with braided dough. Mix garlic into olive oil in a small bowl. Brush olive oil mixture over the top of the bread.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot and the crust is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve cut in slices."
