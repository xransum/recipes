        "Like fruitcake batter, there's just enough fudge to hold the fruit and nuts together.",
        "Spray an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray. Fit an 8-by-16-inch sheet of foil in the pan so that you can use the foil overhang as a handle to pull fudge from the pan.",
        "Place cranberries, apricots, pistachios and ginger in a medium bowl. Then bring sugar, milk and salt to a full rolling boil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Simmer, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and starts to turn a pale caramel, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, quickly stir in marshmallows, then chocolate, and stir vigorously until the marshmallows start to melt.",
        "Pour mixture into bowl with fruit and nuts; continue to mix vigorously (hands work well once mixture has cooled to warm) until fruit and nuts are evenly distributed. Press fudge into prepared pan. Refrigerate until cool and hard, about 1 1/2 hours."
