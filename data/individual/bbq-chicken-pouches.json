        "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray 4 sheets aluminum foil with cooking spray.",
        "Center 1 chicken breast on each prepared aluminum foil sheet and top each chicken breast with 1/4 cup barbeque sauce. Layer corn and green bell pepper over barbeque sauce layer. Fold the sides of each aluminum foil piece over the top of each chicken breast mixture, double-folding the top and ends to form a seal on each 'pouch'. Leave enough space inside each pouch for circulation. Arrange pouches on a baking sheet.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 29 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Open one end of pouch first to let the steam out before opening top."
