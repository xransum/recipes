Using your fingers, press dough evenly onto bottom and 1 1/2\" up sides of pan. DO AHEAD: Crust can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",
        "Using a mandoline, slice lemon into paper-thin rounds. Remove seeds. (If using a regular lemon, blanch slices in boiling water for 4 minutes, drain, and let cool before proceeding). Mix sugar, honey, and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Add lemon slices and toss to coat. Let sit until lemon is softened and sugar is dissolved, 30-45 minutes. DO AHEAD: Lemon slice mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",

        "When crust is almost done baking, whisk eggs and egg yolks in a medium bowl to blend. Whisk flour, cornstarch, and salt in a small bowl; add to egg mixture and whisk to combine. Whisk in lemon juice. Add lemon slice mixture; mix gently to combine.",
        "Reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Pour filling into hot crust. Bake until filling is set and slightly puffed around edges, 25-30 minutes.
