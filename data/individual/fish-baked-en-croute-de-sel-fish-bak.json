        "Spread 1/4 to 1/2 pound of salt on the aluminum foil in the approximate shape of the fish. Lay bay leaves on top of the salt. Place fish on top. Stuff fish cavity with cilantro, parsley, and dill. Pack down remaining salt firmly over fish, leaving head and tail exposed.",

Remove bones in one piece by lifting from the tail and pulling upwards toward the head. Lift the bottom fillet out with the knife or spatula."
