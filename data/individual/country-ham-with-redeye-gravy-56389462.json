        "Heat a large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high. Cook ham, adding 1/2 Tbsp. butter if ham is lean to help the browning process, until browned and fat has rendered, 2\u20133 minutes per side. Transfer ham to a platter.",
        "Pour coffee into the same skillet and cook over medium-high heat, scraping skillet with a wooden spoon to deglaze and loosen any browned bits. Add broth and sugar; simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to about 1/4 cup, 3\u20134 minutes. Add 1 Tbsp. butter and whisk until emulsified, about 1 minute more. Pour gravy into a small bowl or serving vessel and serve drizzled over or alongside ham."
