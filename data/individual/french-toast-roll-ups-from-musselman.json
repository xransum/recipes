        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or grease well (the roll-ups will stick to the pan).",
        "Flatten a slice of bread with a rolling pin to about half of its original thickness. Spread roughly 1 Tablespoon of apple butter evenly on top. Roll up the bread (apple butter side inward) and set aside, seam side down. Repeat with the remaining bread.",
        "In a bowl, beat together the eggs, 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg. Dip each roll-up into the egg mixture, completely covering and shake off the excess. Place on the baking sheet.",
        "Bake 10 minutes. Pull out of the oven, brush the top side with melted butter, flip each roll, then brush the bottoms with butter. (If they stick, gently use a spatula to loosen them.) Leave the bottom side up and bake another 10 minutes.",
        "In a small bowl, add the sugar and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. When the roll-ups are done baking, roll each one in the mixture. Serve warm with dipping sauce (below).",
        "Dipping Sauce: In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese and 1/4 cup of apple butter until smooth. Gradually beat in the powdered sugar and then the remaining 2 Tablespoons of milk."
