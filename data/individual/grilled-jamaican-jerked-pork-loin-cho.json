Season with allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and bay leaves.  Place the pork chops into a zip top bag, and pour in the marinade.  Refrigerate overnight.",
        "Prepare an outdoor grill for medium heat.  Take the pork chops out of the marinade, place on a plate, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes as the grill heats.",
        "Season the chops to taste with kosher salt and cracked black pepper.  Grill the chops on both sides until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  Allow the pork chops to rest for about 5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute."
