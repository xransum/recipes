        "Place the mango, raisins, serrano peppers, garlic, ginger, lemon zest, black pepper, molasses, cinnamon, and cloves into a large saucepan. Pour in the water and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered until a jam-like consistency is attained, about 30 minutes. Stir frequently while cooking. Once thickened, cool, and store in the refrigerator. The chutney may also be frozen."
