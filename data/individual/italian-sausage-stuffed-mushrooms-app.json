Using a spoon, break up the sausage while it is cooking so that any large chunks are broken up. Once the sausage is cooked, place in the refrigerator to cool.",

Take a small amount of stuffing and stuff each mushroom until the stuffing is all gone. Once they are all stuffed, top off with the remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese and bake in the oven for 25 minutes. Take bakeware out of the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Serve hot."
