        "Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Season bass inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff bass with half of cilantro and half of lime slices; tie closed with kitchen twine, spacing 2\" apart (this will hold the stuffing in and make it easier to turn fish on the grill).",
        "Grill bass undisturbed until skin is charred and crisp and flesh of bottom fillet is flaky and opaque, 6\u201310 minutes, depending on size of fish.",
        "Place a metal spatula underneath bass and brace with tongs on top for support, then lift and gently roll it over onto the other side. Cook until flesh of other fillet is flaky and opaque, 6\u201310 minutes. If a small knife or a tester slides easily into the thickest part of flesh, fish is done.",
        "Line a platter with remaining cilantro and lime slices. Place bass on top and remove twine. (Or transfer to a cutting board if you want to fillet first.)"
