        "Saut\u00e9 boned breasts in butter until just cooked through and tender, turning them to color both sides. White meat of chicken is very delicate and will cook quickly. Remove chicken to a deep, flameproof serving dish, or chafing dish. Add a little more butter to pan in which chicken was cooked and saut\u00e9 shallots until just limp. Season with salt, pepper, ground cloves, and ginger. Stir in heavy cream mixed with egg yolks. Stir and cook very slowly over low heat until mixture coats the spoon. Do not overcook or the eggs will curdle. Taste for seasoning. Pour warmed cognac over chicken and ignite. While blazing, pour the sauce over the chicken. Serve with crisp shoestring potatoes and broiled mushrooms. With this, drink Chassagne Montrachet."
