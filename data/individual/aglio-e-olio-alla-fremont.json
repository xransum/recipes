        "Bake in the preheated oven until hazelnuts become fragrant, about 10 minutes. Allow hazelnuts to cool completely on baking sheet. Rub cooled hazelnuts between your palms to remove the bitter paper-like skins. Transfer hazelnuts to a resealable bag and close. Crush nuts using a rolling pin.",

        "Transfer spaghetti to the hazelnut mixture; add Marsala wine. Toss mixture in skillet over medium heat until evenly combined and wine is slightly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Split spaghetti mixture onto 2 plates; top with olives."
