        "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F.",
        "Heat oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until foam from butter subsides.",
        "Meanwhile, spread flour on half of a shallow baking pan. Working with 2 or 3 slices at a time, transfer veal to flour in 1 layer. Lightly season top side of veal with salt and pepper, then turn over to coat completely with flour. Shake off excess flour and stack slices on other half of pan. Saut\u00e9 veal in batches without crowding, turning over once, until browned and just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch. Transfer to a platter as browned, adding new cutlets to skillet as space becomes available, and keep warm in oven.",
        "When all of veal is cooked, bring wine, broth, tomatoes, and olives to a boil in uncleaned skillet, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, then add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and swirl skillet until butter is incorporated. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over veal."
