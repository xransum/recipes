        "Roast turkey 1 hour. Add tomatoes to pan. Roast 1 1/2 hours longer, stirring tomatoes occasionally. Pour broth into pan. Cover turkey loosely with foil. Roast until thermometer inserted into thigh registers 180\u00b0F, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1 hour 50 minutes longer if unstuffed or 2 hours 20 minutes longer if stuffed. Transfer turkey to platter. Tent with foil; reserve pan juices.",
