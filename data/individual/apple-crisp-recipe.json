        "Whisk the oats, flour, brown sugar, pecans, and salt in a medium bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until it is in even, pea-size pieces. Peel, core, and coarsely chop the apples and divide evenly among the ramekins. Scatter the crisp topping evenly over the fruit in each ramekin.",
