        "Let ham sit at room temperature 1 hour for even baking.",
        "Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 300\u00b0F. Wrap ham tightly in foil and place on a wire rack set inside a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham, avoiding the bone, registers 120\u00b0F, 1 1/2\u20132 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, mix chiles, garlic, ginger, tamarind, and 1/2 cup honey in a small bowl; season lightly with salt. Set 1/3 cup glaze aside for sauce.",
        "Remove ham from oven and uncover. Increase oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Brush ham with 1/3 cup glaze and bake 10 minutes. Brush with another 1/3 cup glaze and bake until surface is crisp and looks lacquered, 10\u201315 minutes. Remove from oven and tent with foil; let ham rest 20 minutes before slicing.",
        "Meanwhile, bring wine to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Whisk in reserved 1/3 cup glaze and remaining 1 Tbsp. honey. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add butter 1 piece at a time, incorporating completely before adding more, until sauce is glossy, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt.",
        "Serve ham with sauce alongside.",
        "Glaze can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using."
