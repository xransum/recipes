        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "On a baking sheet in middle of oven toast almonds in one layer until golden, about 10 minutes. Peel, quarter, and core quinces. Cut each quarter lengthwise into 5 slices. In a 3-quart heavy saucepan bring water and sugar to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add quince and simmer, covered, 2 1/4 hours.",
        "When mixture has been simmering 2 hours, peel, quarter, and core apples. Cut each quarter lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick wedges. Stir apples into quince mixture and simmer, covered, until apples are crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in almonds and extract. Cool filling. (Filling may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)",
        "In a large sieve set over a bowl drain quince filling, reserving syrup. Transfer quince to a bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons reserved syrup. Make an egg wash by lightly beating egg with 2 teaspoons water.",
        "Halve dough and on a lightly floured surface roll out each half into a 12- by 8-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch thick). Transfer 1 pastry rectangle to a floured large baking sheet and put quince filling lengthwise along center, forming a 9- by 5-inch mound. Brush pastry around filling with some egg wash. Carefully drape remaining pastry rectangle lengthwise over quince and seal edges by gently pressing together. With a sharp large knife trim edges of pastry. Crimp edges and make a decorative pattern of about 8 slits in pastry, exposing filling. Chill jalousie, loosely covered, 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
        "Brush jalousie evenly with some egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake jalousie in middle of oven until deep golden, about 30 minutes, and transfer on pan to a rack to cool.",
        "Serve jalousie warm or at room temperature with remaining reserved syrup and whipped cream."
