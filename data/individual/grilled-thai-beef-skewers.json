        "Marinate the beef",
        "Cut the flank steak across the grain into slices 1/4 inch thick. In a shallow glass or ceramic dish just large enough to hold the meat, stir together the sake, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes and coriander. Add the flank steak and stir to coat thoroughly. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.",
        "Prepare the skewers and grill",
        "Meanwhile, soak 12 bamboo skewers in cold water for at least 30 minutes. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct-heat grilling over high heat and oil the grill rack. Or, preheat a broiler.",
        "Cook the beef",
        "Drain the skewers. Remove the meat from the marinade, discarding the marinade. Thread the meat onto the skewers, dividing the meat evenly.",
        "Place the skewers on the grill rack, or put on a rimmed baking sheet and place under the broiler. Cook, turning once or twice, until seared, 3 to 4 minutes total for medium-rare, or until done to your liking. Divide the skewers among dinner plates and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
