        "Remove husks from and rinse tomatillos under warm water to remove stickiness. Pat tomatillos dry and cut about three fourths into 1/4-inch dice. In a blender or food processor puree remaining tomatillos until smooth. Cut celery into 1/4-inch dice and finely chop cilantro. Slice radishes and cut into julienne strips. In a bowl toss together all ingredients and season with salt. Salsa may be made 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered."
