        "1. Toss the bread cubes in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper. Lay out on 2 baking sheets. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 15 minutes or until lightly toasted. Let cool, then return bread cubes to the bowl.",
        "2. Cook the sausage in 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat for 20 minutes, breaking up the meat with a spatula. (Pour off and discard excess fat.) With a slotted spoon, remove sausage meat to bread cubes.",
        "3. Place the remaining olive oil and the butter in a heavy saucepan. Cook onions and fennel over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Add the cranberries; cook 5 minutes more. Fold into the bread cubes with the walnuts, orange zest, sage and parsley. Drizzle in the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, to moisten the stuffing. Adjust seasonings. Let cool completely before stuffing the turkey. Cook stuffing inside the turkey or heat, covered, in an ovenproof dish at 350\u00b0F for 20 to 25 minutes before serving."
