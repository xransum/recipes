        "For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "Pulse the cookies in a food processor until finely chopped. With the processor running, add the butter. Press the crumbs into the bottoms of four 4 1/4-inch disposable aluminum pie pans. Bake until set, about 5 minutes. Let cool.",
        "For the filling: In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the chocolate until melted. Set aside to cool a bit.",
        "In a mixer with a whisk attachment, beat together the sugar and butter until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in the melted chocolate and add the vanilla. Beat thoroughly until combined.",
        "Turn the mixer to medium speed and add in the eggs 1 at a time, leaving about 5 minutes between each egg addition. Once the pie filling is well mixed, pour it into the baked pie shells, scraping every last speck of it out of the bowl. Smooth out the filling and place the pies in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, preferably longer. When ready to serve, top with whipped cream."
