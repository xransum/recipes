        "If you\u2019re blanching the bean sprouts, work it into the pho assembly process and use the pot set up for dunking noodles; the noodle strainer is perfect for the job. Blanch them before starting on the noodles to avoid giving them a starch bath, and put them on their own plate so they don\u2019t leak water on other garnishes. Otherwise, arrange the raw sprouts with the herbs and lime on a communal plate.",
        "If the chile is small, cut it at a sharp angle to yield largish slices that can be easily identified in the bowl. Put the slices in a little dish so they don\u2019t get lost. Before bowl assembly, set the garnishes at the table with any other sides and condiments so you can dive in immediately."
