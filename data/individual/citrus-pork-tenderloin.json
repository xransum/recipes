        "Cut small, shallow slits into pork tenderloins using a sharp paring knife and stuff a slice of garlic into each slit. Season pork with salt and black pepper and place into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Squeeze blood orange halves over pork; leave 2 or 3 squeezed halves in baking dish. Pour white wine over pork and sprinkle with cilantro.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a tenderloin reads 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Allow pork to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "While pork is resting, discard baked orange rinds and pour pan juices into a small saucepan. Bring juices to a boil. Whisk cornstarch with cold water in a small bowl until smooth; stir into pan juices. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Slice pork sliced into thin medallions and top with sauce to serve."
