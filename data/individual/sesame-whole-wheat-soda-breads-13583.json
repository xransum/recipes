        "In a bowl whisk together 2 cups of the whole-wheat flour, the all-purpose flour, the baking soda, the salt, and the brown sugar, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in the oats and 1/4 cup of sesame seeds, add 1 1/3 cups of the buttermilk gradually, stirring, and stir the dough until it forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, knead in just enough of the remaining 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour to form a soft but not sticky dough, and knead the dough lightly for 1 minute. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, form each piece into a ball, and flattened the balls slightly. Transfer the balls to a lightly buttered baking sheet, brush the tops with the additional buttermilk, and sprinkle them with the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame seeds. Cut a 1/8-inch-deep X across each bread with a sharp knife and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are browned lightly and sound hallow when the bottoms are tapped. Transfer the breads to a rack and let them cool completely. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month."
