        "Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add leeks, onion, and garlic and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to soften, 5-7 minutes. Add 1 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft, 25-30 minutes. Let cool slightly, then transfer half of leek mixture to a blender and add half of milk, cream, and yogurt. Pur\u00e9e until very smooth; pour into a large bowl. Repeat with remaining leek mixture, milk, cream, and yogurt.",
        "Return soup to pot and heat over medium, adding water by \u00bc-cupfuls, until soup is thick enough to hold potatoes without sinking but thin enough that a spoon dragged across the top doesn't leave a trail.",
        "Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Rinse potato in a colander under cold water until water runs clear; pat completely dry.",
        "Fit a medium saucepan with thermometer; pour in oil to measure 2\". Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Working in batches and returning oil to 350\u00b0F between batches, add potato by the handful and fry, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer potato to paper towels to drain. Fry parsley and rosemary until parsley is translucent, about 15 seconds. Add to potato and let cool; season with kosher salt. Serve soup topped with a nest of potatoes and herbs and seasoned with sea salt."
