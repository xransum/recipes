        "If using turkey, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the ground turkey for about 10 minutes, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks, until the meat is no longer pink. Remove the turkey meat and set aside, leaving oil in the pan.",
        "Place the onion, green peppers, and carrots into the saucepan, and cook and stir for about 10 minutes, until the onion is translucent and the vegetables are tender. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, and black pepper, and pour in the diced tomatoes, frozen corn, black beans, garbanzo beans, and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a boil.",
        "Place about 1 1/2 cups of the chili mixture into a food processor, and puree for about 1 minute until smooth. Pour the puree back into the rest of the chili to thicken. Add the cooked turkey meat, and bring the chili back to a simmer over medium-low heat."
