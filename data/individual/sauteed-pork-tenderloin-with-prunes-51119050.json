        "In a small bowl, pour the wine over the prunes and let soak for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.",
        "Trim the silver skin off the tenderloins. Cut the tenderloins into rounds about 3/4 inch thick. Season the rounds on both sides with salt and pepper.",
        "In a saut\u00e9 pan just large enough to hold the rounds, heat the olive oil over high heat. When it smokes, add the pork rounds and brown, turning once, for about 3 minutes on each side, or until they feel firm to the touch. If they start to get too brown, turn down the heat. Transfer the pork rounds to a warmed platter and set aside in a warm spot. Pour the fat out of the pan.",
        "Drain the prunes, reserving the wine and prunes separately. Measure out 1/2 cup of the wine. Return the pan to high heat and add the 1/2 cup wine and the prunes. Deglaze the pan, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, then stir in the meat glaze, if using. Boil until the wine is reduced by about half; if you have added the glaze, the sauce will develop a lightly syrupy consistency. Add the cream and boil until reduced to a light sauce consistency. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Arrange the pork rounds on warmed plates and spoon the sauce and prunes over the top."
