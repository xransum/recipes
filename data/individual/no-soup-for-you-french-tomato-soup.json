Cook until dried herbs are fragrant, about 1 more minute, then mix in the tomatoes and vermouth. Bring to a boil, then stir in the chicken broth. Bring soup back to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Mix in the fresh basil, oregano, thyme, and garlic. Cover pot, and cook until tomatoes are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
