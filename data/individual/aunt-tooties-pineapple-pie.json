        "While the pineapple mixture is cooling, place the milk, vanilla extract, cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt into a blender. Pulse until the mixture is combined, then add an egg and pulse until smooth. Add the remaining egg, and pulse again until the mixture is smooth. Pour into the pie shell and smooth the top. Carefully pour the pineapple mixture over the pie until evenly covered, then sprinkle with a pinch of nutmeg.",
