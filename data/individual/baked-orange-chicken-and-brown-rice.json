        "Toss the chicken with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Nestle the chicken into the rice mixture. Cover the dish with foil and transfer it to the oven, being careful not to spill.",
        "Bake for 55 minutes. Remove the foil and drizzle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the orange juice. Continue to bake until most of the liquid has been absorbed, the chicken is fully cooked and the rice is tender, about 50 minutes more.",
        "Drizzle the chicken with the remaining orange juice. Sprinkle the mint, pine nuts and desired amount of remaining orange zest over the dish and serve."
