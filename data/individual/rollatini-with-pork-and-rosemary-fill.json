        "To Make Filling: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until golden. Add the pork and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook the pork, crumbling with a fork, for about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary. Remove mixture from skillet with a slotted spoon and remove all but 2 tablespoons of the pork fat.",

        "Heat the skillet with the reserved pork fat over medium high heat until almost smoking. Saute chicken on one side for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Turn over. Turn heat to medium and saute chicken until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes."
