Add the peas and the 1 1/2 Tbs. minced tarragon and stir to coat. Add the water and a sprinkle of salt, and cook until the peas are tender and almost all of the water has evaporated, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.",
        "Transfer the pea mixture to a food processor, add the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (The mixture can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days before continuing.)",

        "Spread the toasts thickly with the pea puree and return them to the baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and heat just until the puree is warmed through, about 7 minutes.",
        "Arrange the crostini on a platter, sprinkle with some pink peppercorns and tarragon leaves and serve immediately. Makes 24 crostini.",
