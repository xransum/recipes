        "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the sugar. In a skillet cook the scallion with the pepper, the salt, and the caraway seeds in reserved bacon fat over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is soft and let the mixture cool. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, the milk, the mustard, the shortening, and the scallion mixture, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Stir in the Cheddar, divide the batter among 4 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2 inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Remove the breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month."
