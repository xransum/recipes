        "Stir mustard seeds in small dry skillet over medium heat until seeds darken slightly and begin to pop, about 5 minutes. Transfer seeds to heavy large saucepan. Add plums, brown sugar, vinegar, onion, cinnamon sticks, and coarse salt. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is thick and syrupy and mixture is reduced to 7 cups, stirring frequently, about 55 minutes.",
        "Ladle mixture into 7 hot clean 1/2-pint glass canning jars, leaving 1/2-inch space at top of jars. Remove air bubbles. Wipe jar threads and rims with clean damp cloth. Cover with hot lids; apply screw bands. Process jars in pot of boiling water 15 minutes. Cool jars completely. Store in cool dark place up to 1 year."
