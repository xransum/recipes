        "Stir pineapple, brown sugar, shoyu, ketchup, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, garlic, and liquid smoke together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer 1 1/2 cups sauce to a bowl and refrigerate.",
        "Place chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour remaining sauce over the top; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Remove chicken from marinade; discard used marinade.",
        "Cook chicken on the preheated grill until caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and cook, turning and basting frequently with reserved 1 1/2 cups pineapple sauce, until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
