        "In a large shallow dish arrange the blade steaks in one layer and add the bell peppers. In a blender blend together the orange zest, the orange juice, the oil, the garlic, the soy sauce, the red pepper flakes, the vinegar, and the salt until the marinade is smooth, pour the marinade over the steaks and peppers, coating them thoroughly, and let the mixture marinate, covered and chilled, overnight.",
        "Grill the steaks and the peppers, the marinade discarded, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 8 minutes on each side for medium-rare steaks, transfer them to a platter, and let the steaks stand for 5 minutes."
