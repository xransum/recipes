        "PREHEAT the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Line an 8\" by 8\" baking sheet or cake pan with parchment paper, lightly grease with vegetable cooking spray, and set aside.",
        "COMBINE the flour, oats, sugar, and cinnamon in a large bowl and stir well. Add the butter and applesauce, and mix until slightly wet crumbs form.",
        "PRESS two-thirds of the oats mixture into the prepared pan, pressing to a uniform half-inch thickness. Spread the jam over the top layer, using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to evenly spread onto the oats. Crumble the remaining oats mixture over the jam to form a uniform thickness. Bake until the top is golden brown, 30 minutes.",
        "REMOVE from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely before cutting.",
        "CUT the cooled cake into bars measuring 1 1/2\" by 1 1/4\" and serve immediately, or wrap individually in plastic wrap. (The bars will keep at room temperature for up to two days, and refrigerate for up to four days.)"
