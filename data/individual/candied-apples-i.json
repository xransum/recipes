        "Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Heat, without stirring, to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads.  Remove from heat and stir in candies and food coloring until just mixed.",
