        "Whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, garlic, brown sugar, and ginger in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken pieces, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.",
        "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking rack with cooking spray, and place on a baking sheet.",
        "Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.",
        "Mix the wheat germ, bread crumbs, sesame seeds, parsley, black pepper, and paprika together in a separate large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken to the bag and shake to coat the pieces with the bread crumb mixture; transfer the coated chicken pieces to the prepared baking rack.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of of a thigh, not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."
