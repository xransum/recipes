        "In a heavy saucepan combine the rhubarb, the sugar, and the orange juice and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb is tender. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, stir in the strawberries, and let the mixture cool. Chill the filling, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
        "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the sugar, the salt, the baking powder, and the cardamom and blend in the orange zest, the butter, and the shortening until the mixture resembles meal. In a small bowl whisk together the milk, the egg, and the vanilla, add the milk mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the mixture with a fork until it just forms a dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it gently for 20 seconds. Pat the dough into a 6-inch round, cut it into 6 wedges, and transfer the wedges to a buttered baking sheet. Bake the shortcakes in the middle of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden, transfer them to a rack, and let them cool.",
        "In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the cream until it just holds soft peaks and add the sugar, beating. Beat in the orange-flower water and beat the cream until it holds stiff peaks. Split the shortcakes horizontally with a fork, arrange the bottom halves on 6 plates, and spoon the filling over them. Spoon the whipped cream over the filling and cover it with the top halves of the shortcakes."
