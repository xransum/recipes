        "Remove all wrappings from ham \u2014 any strings or paper also. Stick ham several times with metal skewer or long fork. This is to let the sauce penetrate the ham. Place ham in a deep roasting pan.",
        "Mix sugar, mustard, and cloves together. Rub over entire ham. Pour juice and cola in pan around ham. Place in oven and bake for 35 minutes at 350\u00b0F. Baste ham with juice. With a pastry brush, brush pie filling over ham. Let cook for 10 minutes. Repeat the basting until all the pie filling is used. Raise oven temperature to 375\u00b0F and let glaze cook well. Garnish baked ham with pineapple slices and Maraschino cherries."
