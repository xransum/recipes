        "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until tender, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Add to Dutch oven and stir until lamb begins to color, about 5 minutes. Add wine and tomatoes with their juices, breaking up tomatoes with spoon. Simmer uncovered until sauce is thick and lamb is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Add lima beans and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Add marjoram and season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)",
        "Cook orzo in large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain orzo well. Transfer to large bowl. Spoon lamb stew over. Sprinkle with feta cheese and serve."
