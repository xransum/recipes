        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread brown mustard onto the chicken breasts to coat, and place them in a baking dish. Bake for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, bring 1/2 inch of water to a boil in a small saucepan with a lid. Add the broccoli, and cook for 7 minutes, or until tender but still bright green. Drain, and set aside.",
        "Shred or cube the chicken, and place onto the bottom half of the focaccia bread. Spread the broccoli over the chicken, and top with mozzarella cheese.",
        "Bake this part of the sandwich (without the top) for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Place the top of the bread over the filling, and bake for another 5 minutes to heat through. Cut into small squares to serve."
