        "Combine all ingredients except grapefruit in heavy large nonreactive pot. Using vegetable peeler, remove peel from grapefruit in strips. Cut peel into matchstick-size strips. Using small sharp knife, cut all white pith from grapefruit. Working over bowl to catch juices, cut between membranes to release segments of grapefruit and squeeze juices into bowl; discard seeds. Add peel strips, grapefruit segments, and collected grapefruit juice to pot. Bring confit to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover pot, and simmer confit until fruit is tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Cool completely.",
        "Spoon confit into small (1- to 2-cup) jars. Cover tightly and chill overnight. (Can be made 1 month ahead. Keep chilled.)"
