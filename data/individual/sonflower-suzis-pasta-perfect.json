        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.",
        "In a skillet melt your butter over medium heat.  Immediately add your onions then garlic; stirring constantly. Add the red bell pepper. Increase heat to medium high and pour in 1/2 of your lemon juice. Sprinkle with black pepper.  Lightly tossing while cooking, add other half of the lemon juice and toss just to coat.  Your butter should be getting lightly browned but not burned and be careful not to over brown your garlic. When vegetables are crisp-tender remove from heat. Toss with pasta and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese."
