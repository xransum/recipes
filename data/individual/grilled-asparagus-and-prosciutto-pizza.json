        "Prepare a hot fire in a grill and preheat a grill-top pizza stone for at least 30 minutes, until the thermometer on the stone registers 500\u00baF.",
        "In a small fry pan over low heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic, then remove the pan from the heat.",
        "Using a rolling pin or your hands, gently roll out or stretch the pizza dough into a 10-inch round. Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour and lay the dough on top. Lightly brush the dough with the garlic-infused olive oil. Scatter the mozzarella cheese evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Arrange the asparagus and onion on top. Drape the prosciutto over the vegetables.",
        "Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone, cover the grill and bake until the crust is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Scatter the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top. Using the pizza peel, transfer the pizza to a cutting board and cut into slices. Serve immediately. Serves 2 to 4."
