        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Wrap the beets tightly in foil and roast them in the middle of the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until they are tender. Unwrap the beets carefully and let them cool until they can be handled. Peel the beets, grate them coarse into a bowl, and stir in the apricots, the molasses, the onion, the oil to taste, and salt to taste. Serve the relish with pot roast or pork."
