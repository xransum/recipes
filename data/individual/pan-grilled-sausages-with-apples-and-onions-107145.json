Add apple cider and chopped sage; increase heat to high and stir until liquid is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Using slotted spoon, transfer onion and apple to 2 plates, dividing equally. Top with sausages. Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons butter into cider mixture. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
