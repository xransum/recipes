        "Place pears and sugar in a large pot. Quarter and seed the lemons and grind in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Add to the pot. Grind enough drained preserved ginger to measure 1 cup and add to the pears. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. Turn heat low and simmer for 1 hour, until a thermometer registers 220\u00b0 or until the juice is somewhat syrupy and amber-colored and the fruit is transparent. (Do not overcook and allow the syrup to get too thick; it will thicken considerably as it cools.) Pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses and cover with a thin layer of paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store."
