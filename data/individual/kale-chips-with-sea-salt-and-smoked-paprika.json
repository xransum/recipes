        "Preheat an oven to 300\u00b0F.",
        "Rinse the kale well and blot dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel. Tear the leaves from the ribs; discard the ribs. Using your hands, tear the leaves into fairly large, appealing chip-size pieces.",
        "Place the leaves in a bowl and sprinkle with the olive oil, paprika and salt. Using your hands, toss to coat evenly with the oil and seasonings.",
        "Arrange the leaves in a single layer on 2 baking sheets. Bake, rotating the pans from top to bottom and back to front halfway through the baking time, until the leaves are dry and crispy, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately; kale chips are best eaten within a few hours. Serves 4.",
