    "directions": [
        "Place the pork chops between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.",
        "Combine crackers, Greek seasoning, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge the pork chops in the flour, then dip them into the egg. Toss the pork chops one at a time in the cracker mixture to coat.",
        "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the pork chops in the butter until golden brown, reducing heat to medium-low if the pork browns too quickly, 10 to 15 minutes. Flip the pork chops, continue cooking until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 more minutes. Serve with lemon wedges."
