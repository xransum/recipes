        "Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and garlic; saut\u00e9 2 minutes. Add red bell pepper; saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add corn; saut\u00e9 until almost tender, about 2 minutes. Add 1/3 cup cream and bourbon. Simmer until sauce thickly coats corn, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/3 cup cream and 1 cup green onions. Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat corn thinly, about 2 minutes longer. Season creamed corn to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup green onions and serve."
