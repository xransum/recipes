        "In a medium pot, saute onions in oil.  Add the split peas, ham bone, and enough water to cover ingredients; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Cover, and cook until there are no peas left, just a green liquid, 2 hours.  While it is cooking, check to see if water has evaporated. You may need to add more water as the soup continues to cook.",
        "Once the soup is a green liquid remove from heat, and let stand so it will thicken. Once thickened you may need to heat through to serve."
