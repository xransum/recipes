        "Simmer lemon juice and zest in a small skillet over medium heat until syrupy and golden, 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Using an electric mixer, beat butter, both sugars, and lemon reduction on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add whole egg and yolk and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually add flour mixture; beat until just combined.",

        "Transfer dough to a work surface, flatten into a disc, then wrap in plastic and freeze for 10 minutes. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12\" round, about 1/4-inch thick. Fit dough into tart pan, pressing it into the fluted sides. If the dough breaks, just press it back together with your fingers. Trim the excess by running a rolling pin over the tart pan. Prick the pastry several times with a fork and freeze tart shell until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake on the middle rack until the tart shell is golden and dry, 30 minutes. Let cool completely.",

        "Meanwhile make the Pine Nut Lace Cookies: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and line a cookie sheet with parchment.",
        "Using a wooden spoon, stir butter and corn syrup in a medium bowl until smooth. Add sugar and stir to thoroughly combine. Add flour and pine nuts and stir until blended and smooth.",
        "Working in batches, scoop level teaspoons batter onto baking sheet 2 inches apart, allowing room for the cookies to spread. Bake until cookies are golden and lacy, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet and then transfer to a plate. Wipe parchment and repeat with remaining batter.",
        "Cut torta into wedges and garnish each slice with toasted pine nuts, candied lemon zest, and Pine Nut Lace Cookies.",
        "Torta can be refrigerated up to 1 day before serving and Pine Nut Lace Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 day before serving."
