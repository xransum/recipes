        "Season the salmon fillet with salt and pepper, and place onto the hot cedar plank skin-side down. Close the lid on the grill, and whisk together the maple syrup, soy sauce, butter, lime juice, and lime zest. Baste the salmon with the glaze, and continue cooking until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes total. Serve the salmon garnished with chopped fresh chives and lemon wedges."
