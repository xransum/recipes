        "To make the roasted garlic, pull off the papery outer layers from the head of garlic. Break into individual cloves, or slice the head crosswise at the root end to expose all of the cloves. Lay a 12-inch square of aluminum foil on a work surface. Place the garlic in the center, drizzle with the olive oil and using your fingers, rub the oil evenly over the garlic. If using the garlic head intact, place cut side down and make sure that the cut portion is well oiled. Sprinkle with 2 pinches of salt. Bring the 4 corners of the foil up over the garlic, twist and press to seal the packet.",
        "Roast until the garlic is very soft, 50 to 60 minutes. You will need 2 roasted garlic cloves for this recipe; reserve the rest for another use. The garlic will keep in its foil packet for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.",
        "To make the sauce, in a small saucepan, combine the tomatoes, the pulp from 2 roasted garlic cloves and the broth. Bring to a boil and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, pour in the wine and add the coriander and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook until reduced by one-third, about 8 minutes. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Discard the solids. Whisk in the olive oil and salt. Season with pepper. Keep warm.",

Rotate 90 degrees and grill until cross-hatching is visible, about 1 minute. Turn the fillets and grill for about 1 minute more for rare, about 2 minutes for medium and about 3 minutes for well done.",

        "Using tongs, place the fillets directly over the heat elements and grill until grill marks are visible, about 2 minutes.

Turn the fillets and grill for about 1 minute more for rare, about 2 minutes for medium and about 3 minutes for well done.",
        "Transfer the fillets to a platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Brush the mushroom caps with the olive oil.",
        "By charcoal grill:",
        "Grill the mushrooms, cap side down, over the hottest part of the fire until grill marks are visible, about 2 minutes. Rotate 90 degrees and grill until cross-hatching is visible, about 2 minutes. Turn and grill until tender throughout when pierced in the center with a sharp, thin-bladed knife, 2 to 3 minutes.",
