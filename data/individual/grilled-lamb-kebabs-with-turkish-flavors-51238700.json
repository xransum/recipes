        "Build a two-level fire in your grill by putting all the coals on one side. When the flames have died down and the coals are medium-hot (you can comfortably hold your hand 6\" above the grill for 3-4 seconds), you're ready to cook.",
        "Trim the lamb of most of the fat and cut into 32 more or less equal chunks. Combine in a bowl with 1/4 cup olive oil and salt and pepper to taste; toss well to coat.",
        "Thread the lamb chunks onto skewers (8 or so per skewer) and place directly over the coals. Cook, turning, until done to your liking, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare.",
        "When the lamb is done, slide the chunks off the skewers into a large bowl, then add apricots, Maras pepper, garlic, mint, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, and more salt and pepper to taste and toss vigorously. Serve warm."
