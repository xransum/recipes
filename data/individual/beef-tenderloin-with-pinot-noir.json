        "Let the beef tenderloin stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat an oven to 400\u00baF (200\u00baC).",
        "Generously season the beef with salt and pepper. In a 5-quart (5-l) ovenproof essential pan or saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, warm the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the beef and sear on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 130\u00baF (54\u00baC) for medium-rare, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer the beef to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for about 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, pour off the excess fat from the pan. Pour the finishing sauce into the pan. Set over low heat and stir until the sauce is hot, scraping up any browned bits from the pan bottom. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter. Cut the beef into thin slices, spoon the sauce over the meat and serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.",
