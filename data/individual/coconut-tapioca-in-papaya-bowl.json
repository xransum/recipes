        "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Stir the tapioca pearls into the boiling water. Reduce heat to medium to keep water at a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently to keep the pearls from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the water becomes thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain. Transfer the tapioca to a large bowl and cover with cold water.",
        "Refill the pot with fresh water and bring to a boil. Once the tapioca pearls have cooled, drain the cool water from the bowl and transfer the tapioca to the boiling water. Remove the pot from the heat; cook and stir again until the pearls are clear, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Transfer the tapioca to a clean bowl and cover with cold water. If the pearls are not completely clear, repeat the process until they are.",
        "Pour the coconut milk into a small saucepan and place over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Once the coconut milk is simmering, stir the tapioca into the coconut milk until the pearls are evenly coated. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool completely; spoon into the papaya halves. Store in refrigerator until ready to serve."
