        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F and line 15 (1/3-cup) muffin cups with liners, dividing evenly between 2 pans (muffins cook more evenly with empty cups among them).",
        "Whisk together flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and zest in a large bowl. Whisk together butter, milk, yolks, and whole egg and stir into flour mixture until just combined.",
        "Gently stir in berries and divide batter evenly among cups (each cup will be about three fourths full).",
        "Bake in middle of oven (or upper and lower thirds if necessary) 10 minutes, then sprinkle tops evenly with sanding sugar. Bake muffins until tops are golden and a tester comes out clean, about 7 minutes more. Remove muffins from pans and cool on a rack."
