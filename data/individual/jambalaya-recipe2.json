        "Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the sausage, onions, bell peppers, celery, and garlic, and saute until the sausage begins to brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the chicken and allow to brown on all sides. Add the herbs and rice, followed by the tomato sauce, stock, hot sauce, and salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally."
