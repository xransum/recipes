Pull off each strip of peel, including pith, with your fingers and put in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. (Reserve fruit for another use.) Fill pan with water, then add 1/4 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Boil, uncovered, 10 minutes, then drain peels in a sieve. Repeat procedure with more cold water and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, then set peels aside. (If peels are not very tender, repeat procedure a third time.)",

Transfer slightly rounded teaspoonfuls of dough, a few at a time, to almonds and turn to coat completely, then transfer to baking sheet as coated, arranging balls about 1 inch apart.",
