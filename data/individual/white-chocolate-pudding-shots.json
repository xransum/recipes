        "Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: whipped cream will form sharp peaks. Add pudding mix and beat until fully incorporated and firm. Stir in Irish cream liqueur and coffee-flavored liqueur. Spoon pudding mixture into 24 2-ounce cups. Arrange on a baking sheet and freeze until set, at least 30 minutes."
