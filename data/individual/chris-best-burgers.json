Press an indentation in the center of each burger with your thumb to keep burgers flat while cooking. Chill the patties thoroughly, 4 to 8 hours. Allow burgers to warm to room temperature before cooking.",

        "Cook burgers on the hot grill until they show grill marks and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Do not press burgers with a spatula as they cook, and flip only once. Let stand 1 minute before serving."
