        "Beat 2/3 cup milk and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk crackers, 3/4 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a shallow bowl.",
        "Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.",
        "Dip each steak into the milk-egg mixture; transfer to cracker mixture and press to coat evenly.",
        "Fry coated steaks in the hot oil until browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer cooked steaks to a serving platter, retaining drippings in the skillet.",
        "Stir 1/2 cup flour into steak drippings until dissolved and pasty, 3 to 4 minutes. Cook and stir onion into flour mixture until evenly coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour 2 3/4 cup milk into onion mixture; cook and stir until gravy is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup oil to gravy; cook and stir until incorporated and gravy is boiling, about 1 minute. Season gravy with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper; serve alongside steak."
