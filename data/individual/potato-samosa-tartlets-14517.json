        "In a large skillet cook the onion, the chilies, the gingerroot, the curry powder, the chili powder, the cumin, the cloves, the cinnamon, and the salt in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. While the onion is cooking, in a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the potatoes for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato, the coriander, the yogurt, and black pepper to taste, cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute (do not let it boil), and let it cool. (The filling may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.)",
        "On a lightly floured surface roll out half the dough 1/8 inch thick and chill the remaining half, covered with wax paper. Cut out 54 rounds with a 2-inch round cutter and fit them into lightly oiled 1/8-cup gem tins. Spoon 1 level teaspoon of the filling onto each tartlet shell and spoon a small dollop of the chutney on top of the filling. Roll out the remaining dough 1/8 inch thick, with cutter cut out 54 more rounds, and fit the rounds on top of the filled shells. Press around the edge of each tartlet to seal the 2 pieces of dough, brush the tartlets with the egg wash, and prick each tartlet once with a fork. Bake the tartlets in the bottom third of a preheated 400\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are pale golden."
