        "Pulse garlic, parsley, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup fennel fronds in a food processor until very finely chopped. With motor running, slowly add 1/4 cup oil and process until smooth; season generously with salt and pepper (mixture should taste quite salty as this is the only seasoning meat will get). Rub parsley mixture all over lamb. Transfer to a roasting pan, cover, and chill at least 8 hours.",
        "Let lamb sit at room temperature 1 hour. Bring vinegar and honey to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 8\u201310 minutes. Set glaze aside.",
        "Place racks in lower third and middle of oven and preheat to 325\u00b0F. Toss fennel and carrots with remaining 1/4 cup oil in a medium bowl and arrange half around lamb in roasting pan; place remaining vegetables on a rimmed baking sheet.",
        "Roast vegetables on baking sheet on lower rack and lamb on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of lamb registers 100\u00b0F, about 1 hour.",
        "Increase oven to 450\u00b0F, brush roast with glaze, and continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer registers 120\u00b0F, 20\u201325 minutes longer. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before carving (temperature will rise to 140\u00b0F for medium-rare while lamb is resting).",
        "Continue to roast vegetables, tossing occasionally, until golden and tender, 20\u201325 minutes longer.",
        "Serve lamb with vegetables, topped with fennel fronds.",
        "DO AHEAD: Lamb can be rubbed with parsley mixture and vegetables can be prepped 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill."
