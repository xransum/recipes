        "Indirect cooking in a barbecue pit is recommended to prevent burning. Cook at 250 degrees F (curled side of ribs facing up) for the first 3 hours, and then increase the temperature to 300 degrees F for the final 3 hours. Sprinkle the ribs with Neely's Seasoning Mix during the last 30 minutes of cooking.",
