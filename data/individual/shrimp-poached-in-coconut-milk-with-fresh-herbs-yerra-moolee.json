Reduce heat to medium, add garlic, ginger, and chilies, and fry for an additional 2 minutes. Add turmeric and coriander, stir rapidly for 15 seconds, and add coconut milk and salt. Cook the sauce, uncovered, until it thickens (about 10 minutes). Stir frequently to ensure that the sauce does not stick and burn.",
