        "In a large saucepan combine the chicken breast, the broth, and 3 cups water, bring the liquid to boil, and simmer the chicken, covered, for 20 minutes, or until it is cooked through. Let the chicken cool in the broth. Transfer the chicken to a bowl, reserving the broth, discard the skin and bones, and shred the meat. In a heavy skillet cook the onion and the garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onion is golden and in a blender or food processor pur\u00e9e the mixture with the tomatoes. Stir the pur\u00e9e into the reserved broth with the lime juice and the chilies and simmer the soup for 5 minutes.",
        "While the soup is simmering, in the skillet, cleaned, heat 1/4 inch of the additional oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the tortilla strips in batches for 30 to 45 seconds, or until they are crisp, and transfer them as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Add the shredded chicken and the tortilla strips to the soup and simmer the soup for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is heated through. Ladle the soup into heated bowls and garnish it with the coriander."
