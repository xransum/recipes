        "Slowly heat milk and cream in a 6-quart pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally to avoid scalding, until mixture foams and reaches 190\u00b0F, 25\u201330 minutes. Add vinegar and 1 1/2 tsp. salt, stir once, and continue to cook, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest until mixture separates into clumps of milky white curds and whey, about 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, line a large sieve with 2 layers of cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer curds into strainer, letting whey collect in bowl. Strain until curds begin to firm up, 15\u201320 minutes, then transfer curds to a medium bowl with slotted spoon. Discard whey or reserve for another use.",
        "Fold chopped herbs and remaining 1 Tbsp. salt into curds. Transfer both layers of cheesecloth to a large plate and spoon herbed curds into the center. Use the back of a spoon to flatten curds into a round 3/4-1\" thick. Gather ends of cheesecloth and wrap tightly around curds. Place a second plate on top and use a can or other heavy object to weigh it down. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight.",
        "Remove cheesecloth and place pressed cheese onto a cutting board. Cut into 1\" cubes and serve or use as desired."
