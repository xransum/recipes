        "With a vegetable peeler remove zest from grapefruit in long pieces. With a sharp knife remove any white pith from pieces if necessary. Stack 3 or 4 pieces and cut pieces lengthwise into julienne strips. Make more strips in same manner.",
        "To a 3-quart saucepan half filled with cold water add strips and bring to a boil. Simmer strips 10 minutes and drain in a sieve. In a small heavy saucepan bring 2/3 cup water, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add strips and simmer gently over low heat until strips are translucent and syrup is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool strips in syrup. Candied strips keep, covered and chilled, 2 weeks."
