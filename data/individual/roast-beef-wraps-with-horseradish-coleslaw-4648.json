Alternatively, open lavash on work surface. Spread half of coleslaw mixture on each tortilla or all of coleslaw on lavash, leaving 1/2-inch border at edges. Arrange beef, roasted peppers and green onions over coleslaw mixture. Starting at edge of tortillas or at 1 long side of lavash, roll up, enclosing fillings.
