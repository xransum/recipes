        "Rub the filets mignons on both sides with 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap 2 bacon slices around the sides of each filet, overlapping the slices slightly, and tie them securely with kitchen twine.",
        "Prepare a hot fire in a grill. Place a la plancha cast-iron griddle on the grill and heat until a few drops of water sprinkled onto the plancha skitter across it.",
        "Place the filets on their sides (bacon side down) on the plancha. Cook, rotating the filets often, until the bacon is golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Using paper towels, wipe the excess fat off the plancha. Lay the filets, with a flat side down, on the plancha and cook until nicely seared and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the filets over and continue cooking until done to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the filets. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil.",
        "In a bowl, stir together the tomatoes, spring onions, salt, pepper and the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Using paper towels, wipe the excess fat off the plancha. Place the tomatoes and onions, skin side down, on the plancha and cook, without moving, until the vegetables are nicely seared, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the vegetables over and cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes more.",
        "Transfer the filets and vegetables to a platter and serve immediately. Serves 4."
