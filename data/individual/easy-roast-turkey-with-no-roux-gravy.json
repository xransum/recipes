        "Mix brown sugar, spices, pepper, and 3 Tbsp. or 4 1/2 tsp. salt in a small bowl to combine; sprinkle all over surface and inside cavity of turkey. Place turkey on a V-shape roasting rack set inside a large roasting pan (if using a disposable pan, place it on a rimmed baking sheet). Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.",
        "Let sit at room temperature 1 1/2\u20132 hours.",
        "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Smear butter all over outside of turkey. Arrange turkey wings (if using), neck, and giblets, then onions, celery, and garlic around turkey and pour in wine. Roast on center rack until skin is golden all over, 25\u201335 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0 and continue to roast turkey, rotating 180\u00b0 halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F (temperature will rise as the bird rests), 1 1/2\u20132 hours. Carefully transfer turkey to a cutting board and tent with foil.",
        "Increase oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Push vegetables, neck, giblets, and wings (if using) into center of roasting pan and sprinkle flour over. Roast until flour is very lightly browned in a few spots, 12\u201315 minutes. Scrape contents of roasting pan into a large saucepan. Add thyme and broth. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by nearly half and gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon, 25\u201330 minutes. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Stir in soy sauce; season with more salt if needed. Bring to a gentle simmer over low heat while you carve the turkey. Thin with a bit more stock if needed."
