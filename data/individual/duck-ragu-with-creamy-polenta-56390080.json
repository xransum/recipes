        "Heat a large heavy-based pot over medium heat. Add the duck, skin-side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook for 7\u20138 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove from the pot and set aside. Drain the fat, reserving 1 tablespoon in the pot, and discard.",
        "Add the leek, garlic, pancetta and thyme to the pot. Cook for 4\u20135 minutes or until browned. Add the tomato paste and vinegar and stir to combine. Add the tomatoes, port and the duck and bring to a boil. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the duck is very tender.",
        "Remove the duck from the liquid and allow to cool slightly. Shred the meat, using 2 forks, discarding the bones and skin. Return the shredded meat to the pot, stir to combine and keep warm.",
        "To make the creamy polenta, place the milk in a large pot over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
