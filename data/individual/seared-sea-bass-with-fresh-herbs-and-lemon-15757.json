        "Chop herbs. Using tweezers, remove any bones from sea bass. Pat fillets dry and score just through skin in 4 places. Diagonally cut each fillet in half and season with salt and pepper. In a heavy skillet heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sear fish, skin sides down, about 3 minutes, or until skin is golden. Turn fish over and cook 2 minutes more, or until just cooked through. Transfer fish to 2 plates. Remove skillet from heat and add wine to deglaze, scraping up any brown bits with a wooden spoon. Stir in lemon juice, herbs, remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over fish."
