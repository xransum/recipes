        "Warm a Dutch oven or similar heavy ovenproof pot with a tight lid over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the beef and sear on all sides until well browned, about 8 minutes.",
        "Add the onion, carrots, parsnip, garlic and mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are lightly colored, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes to reduce slightly. Add the tomatoes, bay leaf and thyme and return to a boil. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 hours.",
        "Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and serve directly from the pot. Serves 4 to 6.",
