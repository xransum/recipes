        "In a separate bowl, combine the confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder. Use a wire whisk to break up lumps. Mix in the vanilla and coffee. Stir in the nuts, and, if necessary, add additional coffee to make the mixture smooth. The mixture should be fairly thick.",
        "Allow the mixture to cool enough to handle. Shape the mixture into 1/2- to 3/4-inch diameter balls. Dip the balls into the melted chocolate. Chill until firm."
