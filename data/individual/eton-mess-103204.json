        "Preheat oven to 225<\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat whites with a pinch of salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually add 1 cup sugar, beating, then beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks. Spoon meringue into 4 mounds on parchment paper and spread each into a 3 1/2-inch round, smoothing tops.",
        "Bake in middle of oven until crisp and firm, about 1 1/2 hours. (If weather is humid, cooking time may be longer.) Cool meringues completely on baking sheet in turned-off oven or on a rack and carefully peel off parchment.",
        "Halve some small strawberries for garnish. Slice remaining strawberries and stir together with Sherry and remaining tablespoon sugar in a small bowl. Macerate 20 minutes. Drain strawberries in a sieve set over a bowl, reserving syrup. Beat cream in a chilled bowl until it just holds stiff peaks and beat in reserved syrup. Spoon cream mixture over meringues and top with strawberry slices. Garnish plates with halved berries."
