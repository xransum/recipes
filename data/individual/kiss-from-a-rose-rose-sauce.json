        "Cut all the leaves away from the artichokes to expose the hearts.",
        "Trim the artichoke stems, and scoop out the fibrous center with a grapefruit spoon or small paring knife.",
        "Mince 1 artichoke heart, and coarsely chop the second. Set the artichoke hearts aside.",
        "Place the roma tomatoes, round tomatoes, and tomato sauce into a blender; pulse several times to mix, then blend the mixture until pureed, about 30 seconds.",
        "Pour the tomato mixture into a large saucepan, and stir in the tomato paste and garlic until smooth.",
        "Heat over medium heat, and stir in the artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, oregano, marjoram, and salt.",
        "Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "Pour about 1/2 cup of the simmering sauce into a small bowl, mix in the liquid smoke and 1/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes. Stir this mixture back into the saucepan.",
        "Pour the heavy cream, sweet white wine, and Parmesan cheese into the sauce and stir to combine. Bring the sauce back to a simmer, and cook until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. The sauce should be a pink color with red patches from the sun-dried tomatoes."
