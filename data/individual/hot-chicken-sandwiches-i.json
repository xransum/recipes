        "Boil the chickens until done, and let cool. When the chicken meat is completely cool to the touch, pick the chicken meat from the bones; set aside. Reserve a little of the broth for later.",
        "Cube the loaf of bread, and put it in a large bowl. Mix in the 12 eggs with the cubed bread. Add the chicken meat you picked from the bone and enough broth from the chicken to moisten. Add salt and pepper to your own taste. Mix well.",
        "Spread mixture into a lightly greased casserole dish, and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes. Or spray a slow cooker with cooking spray to prevent sticking, and pour in the chicken mixture. Let cook on low for about 6 hours. Serve by scooping onto buns."
