        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.",
        "Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, dissolve the honey in the water. Pour the honey mixture into the flour along with 1/4 cup of melted butter to form a sticky dough. The rest of the butter will be used for basting later. When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a well floured surface, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until smooth.",
        "Divide the dough into four pieces, and form each one into a round. Place the loaves on the greased baking sheet. Brush with butter.",
        "Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, basting the tops of the loaves with butter every 15 minutes. After the loaves have baked the full 45 minutes, brush the tops with beaten egg, and continue baking for another 15 minutes, until loaves are a rich golden brown.  When ready to use, slice or break into small pieces for serving in a church communion."
