        "In a saucepan, combine confectioners' sugar, water and corn syrup. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a temperature of 92 degrees F (33 degrees C.) Mixture should be thin enough to pour, but thick enough to coat cake. Stir in the almond extract.",
        "To cover cake: frost cake smoothly with buttercream (see Editor's Note) and place on a cooling rack with a cookie sheet underneath. Pour fondant over iced cake, flowing from center and moving out in a circular motion. Touch up sides with a spatula.",
        "Excess fondant can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for about four weeks. Reheat over a double boiler just until pourable."
