        "Child: Peel the potatoes and carrots. Put the potatoes in cold water.",
        "Adult with Child: This is a perfect way to teach your child how to use the food processor. Depending on the age, keep a good watch over him or her. Use the steel blade or the shredding blade to grate the zucchini, potatoes, carrots, and onion. Show the child how to use the \"pulse\" button or turn the machine on and off frequently so the vegetables don't turn into the soupy mess called a puree. Vegetables can also be grated by hand with an aluminum grater.",
        "Child: In a bowl, mix together the grated vegetables, beaten eggs, salt, and pepper. Stir in the matzah meal. Shape the batter into pancakes, using 1-2 tablespoons of mixture for each.",
        "Adult with Child: Fry the latkes, a few at a time, in 1-2 tablespoons hot oil for 1 1/2 minutes per side. Add additional oil as necessary. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with applesauce."
