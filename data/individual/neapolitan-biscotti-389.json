        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line large baking sheet with foil. Butter foil. Finely grind 3/4 cup almonds in processor. Transfer to large bowl. Add flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon. Whisk honey, oil, egg, yolk and orange peel in small bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until dough just begins to hold together (if dough seems firm and dry, let stand 10 minutes to soften).",
        "Turn out dough onto lightly floured work surface. Add remaining 3/4 cup almonds and knead to distribute evenly. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch-long, 2-inch-wide log. Place logs on prepared sheet, spacing 4 inches apart. Bake until firm to touch and dark brown (logs may crack), about 40 minutes.",
        "Cool logs on sheet on rack 15 minutes. Transfer logs to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place cut side down on same foil-lined sheet and bake until light brown and dry, about 12 minutes. Cool on sheet on rack. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)"
