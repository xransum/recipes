        "Slit guajillo chiles lengthwise, then stem and seed. Heat a dry heavy medium skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat until hot, then toast chiles in 2 batches, opened flat, turning and pressing with tongs, until more pliable and slightly changed in color, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to a bowl and soak in hot water to cover until softened, 20 to 30 minutes.",
