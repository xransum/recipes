        "Make four foil packets by the following method, using 1-foot squares of heavy duty aluminum foil:  fold square in half and smooth flat.  Seal each of the narrow ends by folding over each edge three times to make a 1/4-inch border, smoothing flat after every fold.  You should now have a foil packet that is open on one long side.  Repeat to form four packets.",
        "In a bowl or resealable plastic bag, combine the potatoes, chicken cubes, red peppers, onion, celery, and barbeque sauce; mix well.  Evenly divide the mixture among the foil packets.  Roll up the open end of the packets to seal.",
        "Place packets on a grill over the coals of a fire.  Cook until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is fully cooked, about 25 minutes, depending on the intensity of the heat."
