        "In a 12-inch (30-cm) nonstick fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Season the beef lightly with salt and pepper, add to the pan and cook until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the meat to a plate.",
        "In the same pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Add the onion and carrots and season lightly with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and paprika and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour mix and stir for 30 seconds. Gradually stir in the broth and then the tomato paste and tamari.",
        "Cover the pan and simmer until the carrots are crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Return the beef to the pan, add the edamame and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in the dill and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
