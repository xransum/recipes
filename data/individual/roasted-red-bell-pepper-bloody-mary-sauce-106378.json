        "3. Remove the bell peppers from the broiler, place them in a bag, and seal the bag immediately. Allow the peppers to steam for 10 minutes. When they are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins and remove the stems and seeds. Rinse the bell peppers, pat dry, and set aside on paper toweling.",
