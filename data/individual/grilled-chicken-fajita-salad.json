        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",

        "Add sliced peppers and onions to the oil-garlic mixture. Toss to combine.",
        "Arrange the romaine cut-side down on the oiled grill. Cook just until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.",
        "If you have a grill basket, spread marinated chicken evenly in the basket; otherwise, thread chicken and vegetables on skewers. Grill chicken for 5 minutes. Turn the chicken in the basket, add the vegetables, and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the chicken reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 10 minutes more.",
        "Slice grilled lettuce and place on serving plates. Divide chicken and vegetables evenly over the grilled romaine lettuce."
