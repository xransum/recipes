        "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the ground beef in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno pepper, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, apple cider vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, and pepper to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just losing their crispness, about 20 minutes. Stir in green beans about 5 minutes before serving."
