        "Heat 1/4 cup of corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green beans and baby corn for about 30 seconds. Stir in the paste, soy sauce, and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, then add the shrimp. Cook the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, stir in some water."
