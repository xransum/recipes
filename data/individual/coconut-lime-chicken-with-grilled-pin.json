        "Whisk together the tequila, 2 tablespoons of lime juice, brown sugar, and cayenne pepper; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sauce by whisking together the sour cream , coconut milk, and 1/4 cup of lime juice in a bowl. Add the cilantro and garlic, then season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.",
        "Cook the chicken and pineapple slices on the preheated grill until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the pineapple slices are nicely marked, about 6 minutes. Serve the chicken breasts topped with a slice of grilled pineapple, and a dollop of the sour cream sauce."
