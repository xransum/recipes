Add cashews to baking sheet and roast until nuts are golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Let cool slightly, then peel garlic. Transfer garlic, cashews, and chiles (include all the seeds if you like things hot, or half of them if you aren\u2019t sure) to a blender; add vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 cup water and pur\u00e9e until smooth.
