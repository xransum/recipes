        "In a saucepan combine the sugar and 3/4 cup water and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chopped mint, and let the mixture stand for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. Strain the syrup through a fine sieve into a jar or small bowl, pressing hard on the solids, discard the solids, and let the syrup cool. The syrup may be made 2 weeks in advance and kept covered and chilled. (The syrup will darken but this will not affect the taste.)",
        "For each julep fill a silver julep cup or 10-ounce glass with some of the ice, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the mint syrup, or to taste, and 1 1/2 ounces bourbon, and stir the julep or holding the cup at the rim rotate it back and forth very rapidly. (A frost will form on the outside of a silver cup.) Garnish each julep with 1 of the additional mint sprigs."
