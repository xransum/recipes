        "Heat oven to 425\u00b0F. Set out 3 shallow bowls: Put 1/2 cup flour in the first, egg and egg white in the second and cornmeal and the remaining 1/4 cup flour in the third. Season flour and cornmeal bowls with 1 tsp each of cumin, salt and sugar and a few grinds of black pepper. Stir each bowl to blend ingredients. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil; coat foil with cooking spray. Dust each chicken strip with flour mixture, then dip in egg, dredge in cornmeal mixture and place on sheet. Bake 12 to 14 minutes, turning once halfway through, until chicken is cooked and crust is golden brown. Cut avocado into thin wedges. Whisk dressing ingredients in a bowl big enough to accommodate greens; toss greens in dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top greens with chicken, avocado, peppers and goat cheese."
