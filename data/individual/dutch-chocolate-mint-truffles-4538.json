Simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Add 12 ounces chopped chocolate and butter to cream. Whisk over low heat until melted and smooth. Stir in liqueur and vanilla. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.",

Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture and grated chocolate. Arrange truffles in airtight containers; chill. (Can be made ahead. Refrigerate up to 2 weeks, or freeze up to 1 month.)
