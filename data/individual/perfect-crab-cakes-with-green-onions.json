        "Mix egg, mayonnaise, green onions, Old Bay and hot sauce in a small bowl until mayo is completely incorporated, then set aside.",
        "Lightly break up crabmeat in a medium bowl. Add milk; toss gently to coat. Add crushed saltines; toss gently to combine. Add egg mixture; gently toss, once again, to combine. Using a 1/3-cup measuring cup, scoop up a portion of crab, forming the mixture into a very compact cake. Repeat to make 8 cakes (can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 8 hours ahead).",
