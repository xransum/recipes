        "Stir together the curing mixture, sugar, MSG, mace, mustard, ground pepper, pepper flakes, and garlic powder.  Sprinkle over venison in a large mixing tub.  Mix the spices into the meat, then pour in the liquid smoke.  Mix together by hand for several minutes until very well combined.  Place into a non-reactive (glass or plastic) container, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Prepare casings according to note below, allow to soak overnight.",
        "To stuff, cut off a 2-foot (60-centimeter) piece of casing, pinch out the water, and tie a knot at one end. Using a sausage stuffer or large funnel, fill the casing to within 4 inches of the end.  Tie the open end close to the meat, so that the bologna is firm.  Tie the two ends together to form a circle.  Repeat with remaining casings and bologna.",
        "Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).",
        "Bake the bologna in preheated oven until they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), about 2 hours.  Once cooked, allow to cool, and refrigerate until cold.  The bologna may be kept tightly wrapped in the freezer.  To serve, cut through the casing lengthwise, then slice the bologna into thin slices.  Peel the casing off of the bologna slices and discard before eating."
