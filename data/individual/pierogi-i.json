        "In a large bowl, beat together eggs, carton sour cream, and salt.  Stir in flour and warm water. Add water until dough feels like velvet.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board, and knead until smooth.  Roll out to a 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out 3 1/2 inch circles with either the top of a glass or a  biscuit cutter. Cover with waxed paper to prevent drying out if not filling immediately.",
        "Place 1 or 2 tablespoons filling on one side of a circle of dough. Fold over, and seal by pressing the edges with a fork.  Repeat until ingredients are used.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Immerse pierogi.  Cook until the dumplings float to the surface."
