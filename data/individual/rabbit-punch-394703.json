        "Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from 1 orange and the lemon. Transfer to a large punch bowl and add the sugar. Muddle to release the citrus oils, then let stand 1 to 2 hours. Add the lemon and pineapple juices and the bourbon, and stir to combine. Just before serving, stir in 3 to 4 cups of ice, then top with Champagne or sparkling wine and garnish with the orange slices and pineapple chunks."
