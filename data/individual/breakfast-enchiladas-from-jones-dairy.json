        "In large bowl mix together enchilada sauce and half-and-half until well combined. Lightly coat bottom of large casserole dish with small amount of sauce.",
        "To assemble enchiladas fill each tortilla with eggs, a small handful of Cheddar cheese, and about 2 tablespoons of Canadian Bacon. Roll and place seam side down in casserole dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Pour green chili sauce over tortillas. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese.",
        "Cover with foil and bake for 20-25 minutes until sauce is bubbling and enchiladas are heated through. Let set for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with sour cream and salsa if desired.",
        "To Make Ahead: Cover with foil and place in fridge or freezer. If frozen, let thaw in fridge before baking. Increase baking time by 5-10 minutes if starting with cold enchiladas."
