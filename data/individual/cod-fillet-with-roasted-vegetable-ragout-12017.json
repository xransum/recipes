        "Season cod with salt and pepper. In a large shallow baking pan toss zucchini, tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, garlic, and thyme with oil and salt and pepper to taste and spread in one layer. Roast vegetables in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until they begin to brown. Arrange fish over vegetables and roast 7 minutes, or until it just flakes with a fork.",
