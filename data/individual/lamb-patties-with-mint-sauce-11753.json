        "In a small bowl stir together the lemon juice, the vinegar, the water, the soy sauce, the garlic, the sugar, the anchovy paste, the red pepper flakes, and the mint until the sugar is dissolved. In a bowl combine well the egg, the lamb, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the onion, the bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste, form the mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties, and broil the patties on the rack of a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 6 minutes. Turn the patties and broil them 6 minutes more, or until they are just cooked through. Transfer the patties to 2 plates and spoon the sauce over them."
