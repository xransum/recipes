        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare pie pastry, and place into a 10 inch deep dish pie pan.",
        "In a large bowl, whip egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed until pale. Gradually add 1 cup sugar while mixing. Mix until sugar has completely dissolved, and the yolks are thick and pale. This will take up to 15 minutes. Mix in the tapioca, salt and lemon juice. Stir in the milk, and then carefully fold in the blueberries. In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold egg whites into the blueberry mixture.",
        "Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar with the flour, and sprinkle into the bottom of the unbaked pie crust. This will absorb extra juice, and keep the pie from leaking. Pour the filling into the prepared crust.",
        "Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for an additional 40 to 60 minutes, or until pie is set."
