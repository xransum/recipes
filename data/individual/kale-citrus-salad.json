        "To make the dressing, combine the orange juice, olive oil, sugar, garlic and some salt and pepper in a small jar. Shake vigorously until combined, then add the sour cream or yogurt and shake again until it's nice and creamy.",
        "Toss the kale in half the dressing for a minute or so, then add the citrus pieces and jalapeno slices. Toss again until combined. Add a little more dressing if it needs it. (Extra dressing can be stored in the fridge and used for any salad.)",
        "At the last minute, break the goat cheese into chunks with a fork and toss it into the salad. Serve!"
