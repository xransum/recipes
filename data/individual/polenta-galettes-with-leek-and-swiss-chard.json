        "In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the chard and 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
        "In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 4 cups water and 1 1/2 tsp. of the salt and bring to a boil. Gradually stir in the polenta, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the polenta pulls slightly away from the sides of the pan, about 10 minutes. Butter a 10-by-14-inch baking pan, add the polenta and smooth the top. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.",
        "In a fry pan over medium heat, melt the butter with 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Stir in the shallots and leeks. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the leeks are very soft but not browned and the moisture is completely absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir in the chard, stock, red pepper flakes, the remaining 1 tsp. salt and the black pepper. Increase the heat to high and cook until almost all the moisture is absorbed, about 5 minutes.",
        "Preheat a broiler.",
        "Cut the polenta into desired shapes, such as rectangles, circles or triangles. Drizzle 1/2 Tbs. olive oil onto a baking sheet and place the polenta cutouts on it. Drizzle with the remaining 1/2 Tbs. olive oil and sprinkle with half of the cheese. Broil 6 inches from the heat source until lightly golden and the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.",
        "Divide the polenta among warmed plates and top each with some of the leek mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.",
