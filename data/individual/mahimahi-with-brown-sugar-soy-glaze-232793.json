        "Pat fish dry and sprinkle with salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook fish on 1 side until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn fish over and brown 1 minute. Add soy sauce mixture and simmer, covered, until fish is almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer fish with a slotted spatula to a heatproof platter and keep warm in oven. (Fish will cook through from residual heat.)",
        "Add 2-inch scallion pieces and juices from fish platter to sauce and boil, stirring occasionally, until glaze is very thick and reduced to less than 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Spoon glaze over fish and sprinkle with scallion greens."
