        "Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat butter, yogurt, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Stir in mashed bananas until well blended. Pour banana mixture to flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Transfer batter into prepared loaf pan.",
        "Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes.  Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack to cool completely."
