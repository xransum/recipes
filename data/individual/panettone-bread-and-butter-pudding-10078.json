        "Preheat broiler.",
        "Lightly butter one side of panettone slices and trim crusts if desired. Cut into 3- to 4-inch squares and halve squares diagonally to form triangles. Arrange triangles, buttered sides up,in one layer on a large baking sheet and broil about 4 inches from heat until golden, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Cool triangles and arrange, toasted sides up and overlapping slightly, over prunes in baking dish. Pudding may be prepared up to this point 6 hours ahead and kept covered.",

        "In a heavy saucepan, bring milk to a bare simmer over moderate heat with vanilla bean and granulated sugar and remove pan from heat. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean with a knife into milk, reserving pod for another use, and whisk to break up seeds. In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together whole eggs and yolks and add hot milk in a slow stream, whisking.",
