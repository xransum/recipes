        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",

        "In a saucepan boil salt pork in cold water to cover for 2 minutes and drain in a colander. Rinse salt pork under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over moderate heat and in it cook salt pork, stirring frequently, until browned. Remove salt pork with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.",
        "Pour 1/2 cup fat from skillet into a small bowl and whisk in shallots, white-wine vinegar, tarragon, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste until dressing is combined well.",
        "Fill a wide skillet with 2 inches water and add distilled vinegar. Bring liquid to a rolling boil over high heat and reduce heat to a bare simmer. Poach eggs, 3 at a time, by breaking each one into a saucer and sliding it into the water. As each egg goes in, push white back immediately toward yolk with a large slotted spoon, moving egg gently, and simmer 3 minutes. Drain eggs separately in slotted spoon, blot carefully with paper towels, and trim ragged edges of whites.",
        "In a large bowl toss together fris\u00e9e, dressing, salt pork, and croutons. Divide salad among 6 plates and top with poached eggs."
