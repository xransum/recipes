        "Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place pita triangles on oven rack set in the middle position. Bake until golden brown, 10 minutes. (Store in an airtight tin for up to a week.)",
        "Mix cumin, ginger, cinnamon and cloves in a small bowl. Leave 1/4 teaspoon of the spice mix in the bowl and sprinkle the remaining spices over beef; mix to combine.",
        "Heat a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add meat and all but 1/3 cup of the onion; saute seasoning with salt and pepper and stirring frequently to break meat into a finely ground texture. Stir until meat is fully cooked and all liquid has evaporated from the pan, about 9 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of chutney; cook to blend flavors, about 1 minute longer. (Can be refrigerated in a covered container up to 5 days.)",
        "When ready to serve, rewarm beef and make the salsa: Stir together the mango, cilantro, and remaining chutney, onion and spice mix. Spoon a portion of meat on each pita triangle, top with salsa and serve. Or set out meat, pita chips and salsa and let guests make their own."
