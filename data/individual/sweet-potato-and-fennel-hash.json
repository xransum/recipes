        "Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion and fennel in hot bacon drippings until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add sweet potato, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until sweet potato is tender and slightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
        "Increase heat to medium-high. Pour whiskey into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir bacon in the vegetable mixture. Add brown sugar and stir to incorporate. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until the whiskey has been absorbed and the liquid is caramel-colored, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
