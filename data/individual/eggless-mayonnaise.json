        "Combine the water, sugar, salt, mustard, paprika, vinegar, lemon juice, and powdered milk in a blender. Puree until smooth. With the blender running, drizzle in the oil in a slow, steady stream. If you add it too fast, the mixture will not thicken. Use more or less oil to make it the thickness you like. Store in the refrigerator."
