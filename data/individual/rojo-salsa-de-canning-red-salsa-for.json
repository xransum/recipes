        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Working in batches, blanch tomatoes for one minute and immediately immerse tomatoes in ice water. Slip tomatoes out of skins, discard skins, and chop tomatoes. Transfer chopped tomatoes to a strainer set over a bowl and sprinkle with pickling salt. Drain at room temperature, at least 4 hours.",
        "Beat tomato paste with about 1 cup chopped tomatoes until mixture is smooth and free of lumps. Stir remaining chopped tomatoes, tomato paste mixture, onions, jalapenos, green chile peppers, cilantro, and garlic together in a large pot; bring salsa mixture to a boil.",
        "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.",
        "Pour 1 teaspoon lime juice into each pint jar. Pack hot salsa into jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 20 minutes.",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area."
