        "Place turkey wings and neck, heart, and gizzard in large pot. Add all remaining ingredients; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer gently until gizzard is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Using tongs, transfer neck, heart, and gizzard to plate; reserve. Discard wings. Strain stock and spoon off fat from surface. Measure stock and, if necessary, boil until reduced to 81/2 to 9 cups. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cool 1 hour. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Wrap and chill turkey neck, heart, and gizzard separately for making gravy."
