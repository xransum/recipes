        "Roast the bones",
        "Preheat an oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Arrange the bones in a single layer in a roasting pan. Add the carrot and onion slices. Roast until the bones are browned, 45 to 60 minutes. Transfer the bones and vegetables to a stockpot or Dutch oven.",
        "Simmer the stock",
        "Add the water, salt and pepper to the stockpot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, skim off any foam from the surface and then add the celery, leeks and garlic. Reduce the heat to low, cover partially and simmer for 4 to 5 hours, skimming any foam from the surface. Remove the bones from the pot and discard. Pour the contents of the pot through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard the solids.",
        "Cook the tortellini",
        "In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 6 cups of the stock to a boil. Add the tortellini and cook for about 5 minutes, or according to the package instructions. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Ladle the tortellini and stock into warmed bowls, garnish with the cheese and basil and serve immediately. Serves 4; makes about 5 quarts stock total.",
