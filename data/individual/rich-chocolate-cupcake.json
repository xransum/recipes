        "Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and let cool.",
        "Blend the eggs and sugar with a mixer in a large bowl.  Stir the cooled melted chocolate into the egg mixture.  Add the vanilla extract and instant coffee.  Sift in self-rising flour and stir until well combined.  Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 to 18 minutes."
