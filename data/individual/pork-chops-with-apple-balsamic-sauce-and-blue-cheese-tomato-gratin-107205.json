Sear 3 chops, turning over once, 4 minutes total, then transfer to a shallow baking pan. Sear remaining chops in same manner, then transfer to baking pan (reserving fat in skillet). Roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chops (do not touch bone) registers 155\u00b0F, 8 to 12 minutes.",
