        "Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons water in small bowl. Set over small saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until instant-read thermometer inserted into yolk mixture registers 160\u00b0F, tilting bowl as necessary to submerge bottom of thermometer, about 3 minutes. Remove bowl from over water and add yolk mixture to processor. With machine running, gradually pour grapeseed oil, then olive oil, through feed tube in thin stream, processing until mayonnaise is thick. Transfer mayonnaise to small bowl; stir in shallot and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate."
