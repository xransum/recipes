        "In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the fish sauce, sweet potato and celery root and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in the coconut milk and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the squash and cook until the vegetables are just tender but not falling apart, 12 to 15 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, finely grate the zest from the limes, then cut each lime into wedges. Stir the lime zest into the vegetables.",
        "Serve the vegetables immediately, sprinkled with the cilantro and topped with the lime wedges. Serves 4.",
