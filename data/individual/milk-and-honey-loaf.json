        "In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Allow yeast to sit until it begins to form bubbles.",
        "Add honey, butter, and salt to the yeast mixture.  Stir in flours one cup at a time, beginning with the rye.  When the dough begins to stiffen, turn it out on to a well floured surface.  Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour as needed.  Place into a greased bowl, and turn once to oil the surface of the dough.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, approximately 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Punch down dough, and knead again until smooth.  Split into 3 loaves, and knead for a few more minutes.  Place loaves in three oiled pans.  Allow to rise until double, 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto counter or wire rack to completely cool."
