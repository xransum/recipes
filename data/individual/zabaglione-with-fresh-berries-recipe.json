        "In a copper pan with a rounded bottom, whisk together the yolks and sugar. Set the pan over simmering (not boiling) water or directly over a low flame, if you dare, and continue to whisk while you cook it until thick and pale yellow. Add the wine gradually as you whisk and continue to cook until light and fluffy, about 4 to 6 minutes. Divide the berries among 4 stemmed glasses and pour the hot zabaglione over them."
