        "Beat the butter, applesauce, granular sweetener, and brown sugar substitute with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips, grated chocolate, and walnuts mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets.",
