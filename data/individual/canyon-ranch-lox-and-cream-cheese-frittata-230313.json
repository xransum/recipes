        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. In a large bowl, combine eggs, egg whites, salt, chives, and milk and mix well. Heat oil in a nonstick, ovenproof saute pan 30 seconds, tilting pan to distribute oil. Add egg mixture. Using a spatula, move egg mixture so it cooks evenly, about 30 seconds, or until eggs begin to set. Remove from heat. Spread cheese evenly over egg mixture. Top with smoked salmon. Place pan in oven and bake until slightly browned all over, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cut into 4 equal wedges."
