        "Heat oil in a 12\" (preferably cast-iron) skillet over medium-high. Add onion and cook, stirring, until it starts to soften, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onion and zucchini are softened and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir 1 1/2 cups salsa, scraping up any brown bits from the pan. Fold in the chicken and cook until warmed through, about 1 minute. Transfer enchilada filling to a medium bowl; set skillet aside (do not wipe out).",
        "Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave on high in 30-second bursts, flipping after each burst, until warmed, about 1 minute total. Alternatively, wrap in foil and heat in a 350\u00b0F oven until warmed through, 10\u201312 minutes.",
        "Pour 1 cup salsa into reserved skillet. Working with one at a time, dip tortillas in salsa until coated on both sides; transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet. Divide enchilada filling among tortillas. Roll each tortilla around filling and place seam side down in skillet, arranging in a pinwheel formation.",
        "Heat enchiladas over medium-high. Pour remaining salsa over enchiladas, making sure each is coated. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover with a lid or large baking sheet and cook until cheese is melted and enchiladas are warmed through, about 3 minutes. Top with sour cream, avocado, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges alongside."
