        "In a medium saucepan, bring to a boil water to cover mangos.  Place whole, unpeeled mangos in boiling water and simmer until skin starts to come off.  Remove mangos from water and let cool until cool enough to handle.",
        "While the mangos are simmering, beat the cream and honey in a medium bowl until light and fluffy.",
        "Remove the skin from the mangos and remove the mangos from their pits.  Place fruit in a blender and puree until smooth.  Fold mango puree into cream mixture until well combined.  Mixture should be thick and smooth.  Pour into dessert bowls and chill 2 hours in refrigerator before serving."
