        "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add 3 popcorn kernels to the oil and cover saucepan with a lid. Once the 3 kernels have popped, the oil is ready. Add the remaining popcorn, cover saucepan, and cook popcorn, shaking saucepan constantly, until you no longer hear popping. Remove saucepan from heat.",
        "Transfer popcorn to a large heat-proof bowl and let sit for 2 minutes to ensure better coverage by the butter.",

Transfer the popcorn back in the first large bowl; stir again. Pour remaining half butter mixture into the second bowl and swirl around again; add the popcorn in and mix again."
