        "For salad: Remove rind from watermelon and put fruit in a colander set over a large bowl 5 minutes (to collect the juice). Slice 24 thin pieces of watermelon; set aside. Roughly chop any remaining watermelon and put it back in colander to drip. Zest and juice lemon. Chop enough zest to make 2 tsp. In a large nonreactive (stainless steel or glass) bowl, blend 2 tbsp lemon juice with oil, shallots, and lemon zest. Add 2 tbsp watermelon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add more watermelon juice if dressing is too tart.",
        "For shrimp: Sprinkle shrimp with coriander and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Spray a large nonstick saut\u00e9 pan with cooking spray. Add shrimp and saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until just cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.",
        "To serve: Mix watercress and lettuce; toss with dressing. Add watermelon and avocado and toss gently. Divide among 4 plates and top with shrimp. Serve while shrimp are warm."
