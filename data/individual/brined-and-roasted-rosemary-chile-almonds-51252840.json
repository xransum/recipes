        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Drain almonds; discard rosemary and chiles. Spread out almonds on a rimmed baking sheet; add remaining 4 chiles and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Toss to coat. Roast almonds, tossing occasionally, until dried out and completely toasted through and fragrant, 45-55 minutes. Let cool.",

Working in batches, fry rosemary leaves until bright green and crisp, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Add fried rosemary to almonds, season with sea salt, and toss to combine.",
