        "\"My taste in food is pretty simple,\" writes Sara Hainsworth of Frederick, Maryland. \"I\u2019m a meat-and-potatoes \u2014 and chocolate \u2014 kind of person. My husband, Greg, and I cook together a lot, which is fun and makes weeknight dinners and cooking for friends easier to manage now that we\u2019re starting our own family. I worked before our son, William, was born, but as my husband says, William is my boss now. So I count on these quick, dependably good dishes more than ever.\"",
