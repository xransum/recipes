        "Stir together broth, rice wine, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until cornstarch is dissolved.",
        "Remove any bruised or withered outer leaves from gai lan, then trim and peel stalks, halving thick ones lengthwise. Cut crosswise into 2 1/2-inch pieces, separating leafy parts from thick stems.",
        "Cook stems in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add leafy parts and cook until all of gai lan is just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain well, then transfer to a clean kitchen towel and pat dry. Transfer to a large dish and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.",
        "Pat shrimp dry. Heat wok over high heat until a drop of water vaporizes instantly. Pour peanut oil around side of wok, then tilt wok to swirl oil, coating side. When oil just begins to smoke, add ginger and stir-fry 5 seconds. Add black beans, garlic, and jalape\u00f1o and stir-fry 1 minute. Working quickly, add shrimp, spreading in 1 layer on bottom and side of wok. Cook, undisturbed, 3 minutes, then stir-fry until shrimp are just pink on both sides, about 1 minute more. Stir broth mixture, then add to shrimp and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drizzle with sesame oil, then stir to combine.",
        "Pour shrimp and sauce over gai lan."
