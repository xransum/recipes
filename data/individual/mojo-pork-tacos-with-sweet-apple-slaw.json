        "I preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. I wrap my tortillas in foil with the dry herbs and stick them in the oven.",
        "I get my warm tortilla, put down a layer of avocado slices, then a layer of pork, and then spoon on the epic slaw. I wrap it up and there\u2019s no holding back. So get in there like a shot of tequila and make a mess!"
