        "While the chicken is cooking, in a skillet cook the onion in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly golden, add the remaining 2 garlic cloves, minced, and the tomatoes, and cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, the broth, the jalape\u00f1o, the bell pepper, the corn, the or\u00e9gano, salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the zucchini and bell pepper are tender.",
        "In a large flameproof shallow casserole combine the zucchini mixture and the chicken, sprinkle Monterey Jack over the top, and broil the mixture under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbling."
