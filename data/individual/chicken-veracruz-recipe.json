        "Heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet over high heat. Pat the chicken dry and sprinkle with the oregano and 1 teaspoon salt. Sear the chicken until well browned, about 7 minutes per side. Meanwhile, slice the poblano into strips and thinly slice the onion. Cut the tomato into 8 wedges and smash the garlic. Once the chicken is browned, scatter the poblano, onion, tomato, garlic, jalapenos and olives over and around the chicken. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the wine and bring to a boil; cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Serve the chicken with the vegetables.",
