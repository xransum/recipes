        "Fill a large pot with water, add oil, and bring to a boil.",
        "Place flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle.  Add salt, eggs, and water and beat the dough until smooth and bubbly.  The dough should have a thick consistency.  Fill a spaetzle press with the dough and squeeze into the boiling water (You may use a colander to push the dough through or a wooden cutting board and scrape dough little by little with a knife into the water).",
        "When the spaetzle float to the top of the pot, drain them.  Place half of the spaetzle in a glass baking dish and add a layer of sauerkraut on top.  Add another layer of spaetzle and sauerkraut.  Cover the pan to keep the dish warm.",
        "In a separate pan melt the butter and add breadcrumbs just long enough to moisten them.  Top the spaetzle with the breadcrumbs.  Serve all layers together, or reheat the next day in a little bit of butter."
