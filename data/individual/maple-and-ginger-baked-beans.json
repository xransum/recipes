    "directions": [
        "Soak the dried beans in a large pot of water overnight, then drain. Refill the pot with water, and bring to a boil. Simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour.",
        "While the beans are cooking, mix together the maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, ginger, mustard powder, salt, pepper and water. Set aside.",
        "Place onion wedges into the bottom of a 3 quart or larger slow cooker. Place salt pork cubes over the onion. Drain the beans, and transfer to the slow cooker. Pour the maple syrup mixture over the beans. If there is not enough liquid to cover the beans, add a little more hot water.",
        "Cover, and cook on the Low setting for 10 to 12 hours, or cook on High for 5 to 6 hours. If cooking the beans on High, you will want to check occasionally in case they need a little bit more water. If the beans are too juicy for your liking, leave the lid off for the last 30 minutes to steam off some of the liquid."
