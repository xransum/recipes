        "Peel the potato, grate it coarse, and press it between several thicknesses of paper towel to remove any excess moisture. In a bowl stir together the potato, the bacon, the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, form the potato mixture into 4 patties, and cook the patties, tamping them down with a spatula, for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until the pancakes are golden brown and cooked through. Serve the pancakes with the sour cream."
