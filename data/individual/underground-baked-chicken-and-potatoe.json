        "Cover the hole with about 6 inches of dirt and allow the chicken to cook for 3 to 4 hours.  About 45 minutes before you are ready to eat, wrap the potatoes individually in aluminum foil, and place them in the coals of a campfire to cook.  When the potatoes are ready, dig up the chicken and serve with potatoes."
