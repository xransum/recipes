        "Divide the chopped spinach among the prepared ramekins. Dot each with 1/2 tsp. of the remaining butter. Break an egg into each ramekin and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle each with 1 tsp. of the cream. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet.",
        "Bake until the whites are set and the yolks are firm around the edges but still soft in the center, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
