        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets or line with parchment paper.",
        "Divide dough in half and roll or press each half out onto each prepared baking sheet into rectangles.",
        "Mix crushed tomatoes, pepperoni, 1/4 cup olive oil, Romano cheese, sugar, salt, garlic, oregano, and black pepper in a bowl, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Spread half the sauce evenly over each crust, spreading it all the way to the edges. Drizzle top of each pizza with 2 tablespoons olive oil.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce looks dry at the edges, still moist in the middle, and crusts are crisp on the bottom, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Let cool to room temperature on racks and cut each pizza into 8 strips about 9 inches long and 3 inches wide."
