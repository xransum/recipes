        "Place a cover on the skillet, bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the pork is slightly pink in the center, 30 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Stir sour cream into the liquid in the pan; continue cooking until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes."
