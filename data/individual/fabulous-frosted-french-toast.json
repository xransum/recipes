        "In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon. Melt one tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip a few bread slices into the egg mixture just to coat. Place in the hot skillet, and cook until golden on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices of bread. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet before frying each batch of toast.",
