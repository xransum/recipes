        "In a bowl whisk together the roasted peppers, the mayonnaise, the lemon juice, and the cumin, add the tuna, flaked, the egg, the cherry pepper, and salt and black pepper to taste, combine the mixture well. Split the rolls, divide the mixture between the bottoms, and top each portion with half the onion, 2 slices of the Swiss cheese, and the tops of the rolls. In a large skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it cook the sandwiches, pressing them with a spatula and turning them, for 8 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted."
