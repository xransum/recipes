        "Stir in seeds, cinnamon, and garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes and zest and cook, stirring, 5 minutes or until tomatoes are slightly softened. Stir in wine and cook, stirring, until most of liquid is evaporated. Remove pan from heat and stir in orange juice, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.",

        "Trim ends of zucchini and with a mandoline or other hand-held slicing device, slice zucchini lengthwise into about twenty-eight 1/8-inch-thick strips. On a work surface, arrange fillets in one layer and place about 7 zucchini strips crosswise on top of each fillet, overlapping them slightly and leaving ends of fillet exposed. Carefully tuck ends of zucchini strips under each fillet and with a long spatula, transfer zucchini-wrapped fillets, zucchini strip ends down, to tomato sauce (fillets should be in one layer). Brush tops of fillets with remaining tablespoon oil and bake fillets in skillet in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until just cooked through.",
