        "Combine clams and wine in large pot. Cover and boil over high heat until clams begin to open, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer clams to 6 bowls, discarding any clams that do not open. Add liquid in pot to skillet with ham-bell pepper mixture. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in basil. Pour mixture over clams, dividing equally. Serve clams, passing grilled bread separately."
