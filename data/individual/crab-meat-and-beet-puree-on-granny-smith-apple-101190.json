        "Pick over crab meat to remove any bits of shell and cartilage. Slightly break up large pieces of crab meat and in a small bowl stir together with chives, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Crab mixture may be made 6 hours ahead and chilled, covered.",
        "Unwrap beet carefully. When beet is just cool enough to handle, slip off skin and stem and cut beet into a few pieces. While beet is still warm, using a mortar and pestle mash beet until smooth. In a small bowl stir together mashed beet, vinegar, remaining \u201a tablespoon sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Beet pur\u00e9e may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.",
