Pulse the apple in a food processor, add to the compote and cook for another minute. Take off the heat and remove the vanilla pod.",
        "Halve and empty the passion fruits, reserving the shells, and put into a bowl with the compote. If the compote is very runny, strain the juices through a sieve into the saucepan and bubble over medium heat until thick and syrupy. Pour this syrup back into the compote. If it\u2019s slightly too tart for your taste, add a little more coconut blossom nectar or maple syrup.",
        "Spoon the compote into the passion fruit shells, sprinkle with the chopped cashews and add a little coconut sugar. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes (depending on your oven). Serve sprinkled with the finely chopped mint."
