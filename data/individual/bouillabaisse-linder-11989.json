        "In a large heavy kettle cook leeks, celery, fennel bulbs, and onion in oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. In a very small bowl combine saffron and hot water. Add saffron mixture to vegetables with stock, wine, tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, tomato paste, parsley, salt, pepper, and reserved fennel fronds. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer, covered, 45 minutes. Pour mixture through a large sieve into a heatproof bowl, reserving vegetables (but discarding bay leaves) for another use if desired.",

Transfer fish with a slotted spoon to a large platter and cover with foil to keep warm. To broth add lobsters and cook, covered, 12 minutes. Transfer lobsters with tongs to platter and cover with foil. To broth add mussels and clams and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until shells open, about 4 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer mussels and clams to platter, discarding any unopened ones.",
