        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line 4 baking sheets with Reynolds(R) NonStick Aluminum Foil (dull side up).",
        "Combine the meat with all other meatball ingredients and form into about 80 bite-size meatballs. Place 20 meatballs on each pan, and bake for 35 minutes or until browned all the way through.",
        "While the meatballs are baking, pour the barbecue sauce and the grape jelly into a sauce pan and heat over medium until they are well combined. If you want your meatballs to have a little extra kick, add some hot sauce to the mix. Once the meatballs are finished, you can slide them right off the pan and into your serving dish. Pour your sauce on top and serve immediately. The finished dish does well in the microwave if you are taking it to a party and need to reheat it."
