        "Scrub clams well and put in a saucepan with water. Steam clams, covered, over moderately high heat 5 to 8 minutes, checking them every minute after 5 minutes and transferring them with tongs as they open to a bowl. Discard any clams that are unopened after 8 minutes and reserve cooking liquid. When clams are cool enough to handle, remove from shells and coarsely chop. Carefully pour reserved cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a small bowl, leaving any grit in pan.",
        "Separately chop bacon and onion. Peel potato and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In cleaned pan cook bacon in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until golden. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir in potatoes and cooking liquid. Simmer mixture, covered, until potatoes are tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in clams, half-and-half, and pepper to taste and cook until heated through, about 1 minute (do not let boil). Stir in parsley."
