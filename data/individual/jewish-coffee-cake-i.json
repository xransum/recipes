        "Beat the 3/4 cup of butter and 1 1/4 cups of sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Batter will be thick. Pour the batter into prepared pan.",
