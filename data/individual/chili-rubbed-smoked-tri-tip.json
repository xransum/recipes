        "To make the pico de gallo, in a bowl, stir together the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o and lime juice. Season with salt. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend. The salsa will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",
        "About 1 hour before you are ready to begin grilling, remove the roast from the refrigerator. Season the roast on all sides with the chili powder, garlic salt and a generous amount of pepper.",
        "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for smoking over medium heat; the temperature inside the grill should be 350\u00b0 to 375\u00b0F. If using charcoal, bank the lit coals on either side of the grill bed, leaving a strip in the center without heat. Place a drip pan in the center strip and fill the pan with water. Add about 2 cups of the wood chips to the fire just before grilling. If using gas, fill the smoker box with up to 2 cups of the wood chips, then preheat the grill. Turn off 1 or more of the burners to create a cooler zone. Brush and oil the grill grate.",
        "Place the roast on the grill over the direct-heat area and sear, turning as needed, until browned but not charred on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes total. Move the roast to the indirect-heat area, cover the grill, and cook for about 45 minutes for medium-rare or 1 hour for medium, adding the remaining wood chips after about 30 minutes. Tri-tip roasts come in different shapes\u2014some are squat, and some are more rounded\u2014so cooking times will vary. Remove the roast when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 130\u00b0F for medium-rare or 135\u00b0F for medium.",
        "Transfer the roast to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Slice very thinly against the grain, capturing any released juices, and arrange on a platter. Pour any accumulated juices over the top and serve immediately with the pico de gallo. Serves 6 to 8 with leftovers.",
