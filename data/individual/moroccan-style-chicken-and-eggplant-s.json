        "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, wide pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions and garlic until onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Stir paprika, kosher salt, coriander, fennel seeds, black pepper, cumin, ginger, and turmeric into onion mixture; cook and stir for 1 minute.",
        "Mix tomatoes, half of the reserved tomato juice, red bell peppers, white wine, and lemon juice into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reserve the remaining tomato juice to thin the stew if needed.",
        "Arrange chicken in a single layer in the pot; cover with some of the tomato mixture. Return stew to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Flip chicken, cover, and simmer until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
