        "Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Pat the fillet dry, season it with salt and pepper, and in a small roasting pan roast it in the middle of the oven for 23 minutes, or until it registers 125\u00b0F. on a meat thermometer for rare meat. Transfer the fillet to a cutting board and let it cool. The fillet may be roasted 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.",
        "In a blender pur\u00e9e the artichoke hearts and the garlic with the vinegar, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste and transfer the pur\u00e9e to a bowl. The pur\u00e9e may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.",
        "Spread each slice of toast with some of the artichoke pur\u00e9e, top the pur\u00e9e with some of the arugula, and divide the fillet, sliced very thin, among the crostini. Top the crostini with the Parmesan curls."
