        "Meanwhile, cut the baguette on the diagonal into 18 slices each 1/2 inch thick. (You may not need the whole loaf.) Arrange the bread slices on a rimmed baking sheet and brush the tops lightly with olive oil. Bake until golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.",
        "Arrange the toasts on a serving platter or divide among individual plates. Spoon the beans on the toasts, dividing them evenly. Drizzle generously with olive oil, then top with the arugula. Serve immediately. Serves 6.",
