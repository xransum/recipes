        "Whisk potato starch, baking powder, and 3/4 cup arepa flour in a large bowl. Whisk in 2 1/3 cups water; let sit 30 minutes to allow flour to hydrate. Place remaining 1 cup arepa flour in a shallow bowl.",
        "Meanwhile, whisk egg yolk, garlic, and lemon juice in a small bowl to combine. Whisking constantly, gradually drizzle in grapeseed oil and olive oil; whisk until sauce is thickened and emulsified. Season aioli with salt; stir in 1 tsp. water.",
        "Fit a large pot with thermometer; pour in vegetable oil to come 3\" up sides of pot. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 375\u00b0F.",
        "Meanwhile, cut squid. Slice bodies lengthwise along one side and open to expose interior. Cut in half crosswise (or in thirds if large). Cut each half (or third) into 1 1/2\" triangles; cut tentacles in half. Rinse; pat dry.",
        "Working in batches of 5 or 6 and returning oil to 375\u00b0F between batches, dredge squid, scallions, and lemon in arepa flour, shaking off excess; dip into batter, letting extra drip off. Fry, turning every 30 seconds or so, until golden, crisp, and puffed, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels; season with salt. Top with basil and serve with aioli."
