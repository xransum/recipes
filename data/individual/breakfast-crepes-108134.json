        "In a blender, combine milk and eggs. Mix on medium-high speed until foamy, about 10 seconds. Turn blender to low speed and remove feed top. With blender going, add sugar and salt. Replace feed top and blend on high speed for a few seconds, then turn blender back to low. In the same manner, add butter, brandy, and vanilla, replacing feed top and blending for several seconds after each addition. Turn blender off. Add flour all at once and blend until just combined.",
        "Place cr\u00eape pan over moderately high heat. With flexible spatula, spread a tiny amount of butter in pan (an alternative method is to brush the pan with melted butter using a pastry brush) and heat until butter just begins to smoke. Pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup batter into the pan. As you pour, quickly tilt the pan in all directions to spread a thin layer of batter across the bottom. Pour in just enough batter to cover the pan.",
        "Cook cr\u00eape over moderately high heat until bubbles just begin to form on the exposed surface, about one to two minutes. Lift up the edge to check the cooking process \u2014 if the cr\u00eape starts to burn before it is cooked through, turn down the heat. If it is not nicely browned after two minutes, turn up the heat.",
        "When underside of cr\u00eape is browned, flip and cook another minute or less, until other side is browned. Remove from pan and keep warm in the oven, loosely covered with foil.",
        "Grease pan with a very small amount of butter and repeat process. Continue until all batter is used, stacking cooked cr\u00eapes on a plate in the oven. To serve, sprinkle each cr\u00eape with sugar or spread with jelly and fold or roll up."
