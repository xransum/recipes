        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook the linguine 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.",
        "Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over high heat, and cook and stir the chorizo sausage 2-3 minutes, until evenly browned. Set aside the sausage, and wipe the skillet. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil, and toss in the scallops. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook and stir about 3 minutes, until opaque and lightly browned. Set aside. Wipe the skillet, and heat another 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat. Cook and stir the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper until tender. Remove from heat, and set aside.",
        "Heat the remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium high heat, and cook and stir the garlic until tender. Pour in the wine, and bring to a boil. Cook until most of the wine has been reduced, and scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Mix in the clam juice, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by about 1/2. Return the chorizo, scallops, and peppers to the skillet, and toss until coated. Serve over the cooked linguine."
