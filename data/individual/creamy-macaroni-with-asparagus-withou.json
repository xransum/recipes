        "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic until just beginning to turn golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in the asparagus, and cook and stir until the pieces are bright green, about 2 more minutes. Stir in the pasta, tossing to coat with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
        "Pour boiling water into the saucepan, and bring back to a boil. This recipe should be as dry as possible. Stir the pasta mixture frequently to prevent sticking, and cook the pasta until tender but still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. If there is excess liquid, drain from the pasta.",
        "Stir the eggs, grated Romano cheese, and parsley together in a bowl. Pour into the pasta mixture, stirring and pouring simultaneously until the eggs cook with the heat of the pasta. Sprinkle with additional parsley leaves, and serve."
