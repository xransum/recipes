        "Remove the stems and some of the seeds from the ancho, arbol and guajillo chiles; then tear the chiles into large pieces. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, toast the chiles until they start to change color, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup hot water to just cover the chiles; turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let steam for 15 minutes. Transfer the chiles and liquid to a blender and puree until smooth. Pour into a bowl and set aside.",
        "In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, onions, peppers, Fresno chiles and Anaheim peppers. Cook until the onions are translucent, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside on a baking sheet or in a bowl.",
        "Sprinkle the beef chuck and ground beef with salt and pepper, then add to the Dutch oven. Cook until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, oregano, cayenne and cinnamon; saute until fragrant, about 2 more minutes. Add the sauteed vegetables, beef stock and the chile puree, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil and reduce to a very low simmer. Simmer until the beef is very tender and the liquid has reduced, about 2 hours. Stir in the beer and paprika, then add the masa harina to tighten sauce. Stir over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, breaking up some of the beef so it gets worked into the sauce slightly. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm.",
        "Serve generous portions of chili in bowls, drizzled with Cheddar Beer Cheese Sauce and garnished with sour cream, scallions, red onion and crackers.",
