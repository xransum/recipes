        "Pour oil into a large, heavy skillet; place over medium high heat.  Heat oil until hot, but not smoking.  Reduce heat to low, and add onion, celery, and green pepper.  If using diced hot peppers, stir in now.  Saute until the onion is soft; be careful not to burn onion.  Remove vegetables from skillet, and wipe out excess liquid with paper towel.",
