        "Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Arrange 24 pretzel crisps face down on the sheet.",
        "Scoop 1 teaspoon peanut butter on each pretzel crisp. Top with the remaining pretzel crisps face up pressing down lightly to flatten into a \"sandwich.\"",
        "Melt chips or melts in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.",
        "Use small tongs to dip each \"sandwich\" into the melted candy (or use a fork or spoon to drizzle the coating over it.) Let excess coating drip into the bowl; place dipped sandwiches onto the baking sheet.",
        "Let stand until the candy sets. You can speed up the process by placing them in the refrigerator."
