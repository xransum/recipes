        "Roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop, using metal tongs to hold them, until the skin is totally charred. (If you don't have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven's broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes.",
        "Divide the ingredients into 3 batches so they will fit into a 12-cup processor",
        "Combine whole tomatoes, roast chiles, cilantro, onions, garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt, sugar and lime juice in a blender or food processor.",
        "Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you'd like. I do about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed.",
        "Refrigerate the salsa for at least an hour before serving."
