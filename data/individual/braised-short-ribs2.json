        "Season the short ribs with salt and pepper. Dredge the ribs in the flour and shake off the excess.",
        "In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker or in a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Working in batches, brown the short ribs on all sides, about 3 minutes per side.",
        "If using a slow-cooker insert, return all the ribs to the insert, add the braising sauce and transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base. If using a fry pan, transfer the ribs to a slow cooker and add the braising sauce. Cover and cook on low according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the meat is tender, 6 to 7 hours.",
        "Transfer the ribs to a plate. Skim the fat off the sauce. Set the slow-cooker insert on the stovetop. If you used a regular slow cooker, transfer the sauce to a saucepan. Simmer over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve the short ribs with the sauce. Serves 4 to 6."
