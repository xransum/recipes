        "Fill a saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.",
        "Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; add onions, garlic, ginger, and turmeric. Cook and stir until onions start to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, fish sauce, chile powder, and salt. Add a tablespoon or two of water if mixture looks dry or starts to stick. Cook until chicken is tender and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.",
