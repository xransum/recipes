        "In a stock pot, melt butter over medium heat. When butter is bubbling, add flour to make a roux, stirring constantly to prevent or remove any lumps. Cook the roux for 5 minutes. Do not brown.",
        "Stir in onions and bell peppers; saute 10 minutes, or until onions are translucent. Add garlic, and saute for 3 minutes. Stir in crawfish tails. Slowly pour in enough water to reach a little thicker than soup-like consistency. Season with cumin, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce,  and salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes."
