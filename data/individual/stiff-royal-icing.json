        "Beat both amounts of meringue powder, 1 cup warm water, cream of tartar, and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer on low. Scrape down sides of bowl and increase mixer speed to medium; beat until fluffy and shiny, 6 to 8 minutes. If frosting is too stiff, beat in 2 tablespoons warm water, or as needed, adding water in small amounts. Keep frosting covered with a damp towel until needed."
