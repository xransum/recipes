        "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 10 inch round cake pan, and line with parchment paper. Combine the dates and whiskey in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer for 1 minute, then set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, beat the butter, sugar, and golden syrup until smooth. Stir in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the almond meal. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the batter alternately with the milk, and beat until smooth. Blend in the date mixture, mixing only as much as necessary. Pour into the prepared pan, and spread evenly.",
        "Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then invert onto a plate and dust with confectioners' sugar."
