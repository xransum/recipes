        "Whisk 1 1/8 cups flour, white sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Press 1/2 cup butter pieces into flour mixture with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.",
        "Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour water and vanilla into well; quickly work water and vanilla into flour to create a loose dough, adding more water if the dough is crumbly. You should be able to squeeze it in your hand and have it stay together but be a bit crumbly. Shape dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Stir brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Add apples and toss to coat. Let sit for flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).",
        "Roll dough out into a large, rough circle on a baking stone or baking sheet. Pour apple mixture into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch uncovered border, and dot apples with 1 tablespoon butter.",
        "Fold edges of dough up over the apples, leaving an opening in the center. Dot dough with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and sprinkle coarse sugar over the dough.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is crisp and golden and apples are tender and caramelized, 40 to 45 minutes."
