Temper the chocolate . Add the almonds and diced orange peel and mix well. Using a spoon, make small mounds of the mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to set before detaching the rochers from the paper. (Store for up to 1 month in an airtight container away from moisture.)"
