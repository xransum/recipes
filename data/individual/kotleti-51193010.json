        "2. With wet hands, shape the mixture into oval patties approximately 3 1/2 inches long. Spread bread crumbs on a large plate or a sheet of wax paper. Coat patties in crumbs, \ufb02attening them out slightly and pressing down for the crumbs to adhere.",
        "3. In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the oil with a pat of butter until sizzling. Working in batches, fry the kotleti over medium-high heat until golden-brown, about 4 minutes per side. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes to cook through. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with the rest of the patties. Serve at once."
