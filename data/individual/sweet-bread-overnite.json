        "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.",
        "In a large bowl, beat eggs until fluffy. Stir in 4 cups of flour, salt, sugar, milk, 3/4 cup melted butter, yeast mixture and vanilla. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise overnight in the refrigerator.",
        "The next morning, deflate the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes. Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).",
        "Brush risen loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until golden brown."
