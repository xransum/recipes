        "Cook tortillas over gas flame until blackened in spots, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to work surface. Sprinkle 4 tortillas with both cheeses and hominy, dividing equally; top with remaining 4 tortillas. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium heat. Place 2 quesadillas in each skillet. Cook until bottoms are crisp and brown, pressing occasionally with spatula, about 2 minutes. Turn quesadillas over. Cook until bottoms are brown and cheeses melt, adding more oil as needed, about 2 minutes longer. Cut quesadillas into quarters. Arrange 4 quarters on each of 4 plates. Serve with salsa."
