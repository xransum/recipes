        "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie dish with 2 teaspoons of the oil.",
        "Toss the hash browns, the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl to mix well. Gently press the hash browns into the prepared pie dish to form a crust, and spray with cooking spray. Bake the crust until it begins to look dry, about 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, and bake until golden brown, 20 minutes more; set aside until cool to the touch. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.",
        "Beat the eggs, half-and-half, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Place the tomatoes, basil and chives on the crust, pour the egg mixture over them and top with the mozzarella. Bake until the center is firm and the quiche no longer jiggles, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes, then slice and serve."
