        "Blend together butter, cheese, and yolk in a food processor until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and pulse until just combined. (If you have a small processor, divide butter mixture after blending and pulse with remaining ingredients in 2 batches.) Transfer dough (it will be very soft) to a bowl and chill, covered, 15 minutes.",
        "Halve dough, then shape each half into a 12-inch log on a lightly floured surface. Wrap logs in wax paper and foil, then chill until firm, at least 4 hours.",
        "Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.",
        "Unwrap logs and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices with a sharp thin knife, then arrange slices about 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Bake in batches, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until pale golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer crackers to racks to cool, about 5 minutes. Line sheets with clean parchment between batches."
