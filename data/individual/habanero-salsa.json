        "Place jalapenos, onions, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper into the bowl of a blender or food processor.  Pulse to chop and blend, then pour into a large bowl, and mix with the can of green chiles, cilantro, and lime juice.  Pulse the tomatoes in batches to desired size, and add to green chile mixture.",
