        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Place stack of phyllo sheets on work surface and cover with plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel to prevent drying. Transfer 1 phyllo sheet to prepared baking sheet (keep remaining phyllo covered). Brush phyllo sheet lightly with some of melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with scant 1 teaspoon sugar. Top with second phyllo sheet; brush with melted butter and sprinkle with scant 1 teaspoon sugar. Repeat with remaining 6 phyllo sheets, melted butter, and sugar.",
        "Spoon almond cream in dollops atop phyllo, then carefully spread evenly over, leaving 1/2-inch plain border on all sides. Using palm of hand, fan out 7 apple slices, side by side and slightly overlapping, on work surface. Using spatula, transfer fanned-out apple slices to corner of 1 short side of phyllo. Repeat fanning out 7 apple slices at a time, arranging in 2 to 3 lengthwise rows atop almond cream, spacing close together.",

        "Combine preserves and 3 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring to loosen. Brush preserves over apples and tart crust. Using 2 large metal spatulas, transfer tart to platter and serve warm or at room temperature.",
