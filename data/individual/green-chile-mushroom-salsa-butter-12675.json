        "While vegetables are roasting, if using dried morels, in a small bowl soak in hot water until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove morels from soaking liquid and halve. Strain soaking liquid through a sieve lined with paper towels into another small bowl, reserving soaking liquid. If using fresh morels, wash well, pat dry, trim, and halve.",
        "In a small heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut\u00e9 dried or fresh morels, stirring, until browned lightly, about 1 minute. If using dried morels, add reserved soaking liquid and boil until liquid is evaporated. Saut\u00e9 dried or fresh morels, stirring until browned, about 3 minutes more.",
