        "In a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, combine the ground beef, salt and sugar and cook, stirring, until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the meat and transfer to a slow cooker.",
        "In the same pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes; do not allow it to brown. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, pepper and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juices and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, then pour the mixture into the slow cooker. Add the stock and cornmeal. Cover and cook for 6 hours on high or 8 hours on low. After the chili is cooked, skim off any fat from the surface.",
        "Preheat an oven to 375\u00b0F.",
        "Prepare the corn bread batter according to the package instructions. Divide the chili evenly among 8 ovenproof bowls. Top each with a scant 1/2 cup of the batter. Using a small offset spatula, spread the batter over the center two-thirds of the chili, being careful not to mix the batter with the chili. Place the bowls on a baking sheet and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the corn bread comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately. Serves 8.",
