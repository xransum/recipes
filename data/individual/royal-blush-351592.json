        "In a bowl, pur\u00e9e frozen cherries or all-fruit spread with water. In general: 1 cup of frozen cherries (6 ounces) pur\u00e9ed with 2 tablespoons of water makes approximately 3/4 cup pur\u00e9e. To make pur\u00e9e using all-fruit spread, combine 3/4 cup spread with 3/4 cup water. Any extra can be used to make smoothies or sauce for ice cream.",
        "Transfer pur\u00e9e to chilled martini glass. In chilled cocktail shaker, combine vodka, lime juice, and simple syrup. Tear mint leaves in half and add to shaker. Add ice and shake vigorously for 15 seconds. Slowly strain into martini glass without disturbing pur\u00e9e, then top with sparkling wine and serve."
