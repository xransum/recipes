        "Using the dull side of a knife, \"chop\" the rosemary sprigs to bruise them and release their fragrance. Season chops with pepper (no salt) and place in a resealable plastic bag along with the garlic, rosemary, and pomegranate juice. Seal bag; massage gently to distribute flavors. Refrigerate for about 1 hour.",
        "Place orange marmalade into a saucepan. Add vinegar and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove from heat. Pour through a fine strainer to remove orange rind. Add pepper flakes. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes. When cold, stir in mint (if jelly is still warm, mint will turn black) until combined.",
        "Remove lamb from marinade; discard marinade. Salt both sides of the lamb chops. Lightly drizzle with about 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil.",
        "Lightly oil a grill and set at medium-high heat. Cook chops until browned and meat is medium rare, about 5 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).",
