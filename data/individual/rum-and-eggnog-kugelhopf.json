        "In a saucepan, heat the eggnog to a boil. Pour it into a large bowl and add 1 1/2 cups of bread flour. Mix until smooth and let the mixture cool to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) or just warm to the touch. Add the instant yeast and mix until blended. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, 20 to 30 minutes.",

Pour the egg mixture into the dough and mix until smooth. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of bread flour and mix for 3 minutes. The dough will be very sticky. Stir in the currants, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.",
