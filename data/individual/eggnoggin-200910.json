        "Beat the egg yolks until they are light and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is thick and light-colored. Turn the mixture into a chilled punch bowl set in crushed ice. Stir in slowly the bourbon, Cognac, heavy white rum, and the apricot liqueur. Blend in the milk and heavy cream, whipped just to a froth, and fold in the egg whites, stiffly beaten. Sprinkle the punch with orange-flower water. Serve in 4-ounce glass noggins (small cups) and sprinkle each serving with powdered zest of orange."
