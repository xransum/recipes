        "Put the chicken in a large casserole with the onion, carrot, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Add enough water to cover the chicken, then bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour, or until the meat is white. Carefully lift the chicken from the broth and let cool. Strain the broth and save 2 1/2 cups for the sauce.",
        "Make the sauce. Melt the butter in a large pan. Add the sliced artichokes and fennel and cook for 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir until the flour and butter have combined. Pour in half the reserved chicken broth and stir until smooth. Add the remaining chicken broth and the horseradish and bring to a boil. Add the cream and salt and pepper and return the sauce to a boil, then decrease the heat to a simmer.",
        "Remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Break the meat into medium-size pieces. Stir the chicken and chervil into the sauce and let it simmer for a couple of minutes, or until the chicken is heated through. Season with salt and pepper and serve with boiled potatoes."
