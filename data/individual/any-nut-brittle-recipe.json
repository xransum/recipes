        "Combine the sugar and corn syrup in a heavy bottomed pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the sugar has dissolved. Turn the heat up to high and cook until the bubbles get smaller and the mixture turns a light amber color, about 10 minutes. Stir in the nuts and cook for 1 more minute. Quickly pour the mixture onto a baking pan lined with a silicone baking sheet (or buttered parchment paper) and spread it out evenly with a spatula or wooden spoon. The mixture cools quickly so work fast. Let cool and break into pieces."
