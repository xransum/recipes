        "Unwrap the ham and rinse it under cold water. Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover with foil and bake 1 hour 40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar and honey in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the mixture is smooth and the sugar has dissolved.",
        "Pour the brown sugar glaze over the ham and continue roasting1 hour 40 minutes more, basting at least twice with the drippings in the roaster. (To adjust the total roasting time for a smaller or larger ham, calculate 20 minutes per pound.) Check for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into a meaty spot (not into fat or touching the bone)-it should register 160 degrees F.",
        "Let the ham stand 15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to set. (You can make the ham up to 2 hours ahead; tent with foil and serve at room temperature.)",
