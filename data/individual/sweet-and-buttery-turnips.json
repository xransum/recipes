    "directions": [
        "Place turnips into saucepan and fill with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Add butter to the hot turnips and mash with a potato masher or whisk. Once the butter has melted in, stir in the sour cream, half-and-half, brown sugar, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mash to your desired consistency. I always undermash for a chunkier outcome. Cover and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve."
