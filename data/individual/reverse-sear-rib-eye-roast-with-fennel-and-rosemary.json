        "Working in 2 batches, scatter rosemary over a paper towel\u2013lined plate. Top with another sheet of paper towel and microwave on high 1 minute. Check rosemary and continue to microwave in 20-second intervals, until dry and crisp. Grind rosemary in spice mill or with mortar and pestle to a powder. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in fennel pollen.",
        "Place roast, fat side down, on a cutting board with a long side facing you. Using a sharp slicing knife and long strokes, cut roast into two 3-bone roasts. French rib bones 1 1/2\" from tip of bones, if desired. Score fat cap in a crosshatch pattern, spacing cuts 1\" apart. Rub roasts all over with garlic, then coat with rosemary mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place, fat cap up, on a rack, set inside a roasting pan. Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.",
        "Let roasts sit at room temperature 2 hours for even roasting.",
        "Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 225\u00b0F. Roast meat, rotating pan once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of roasts registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, or 130\u00b0F for medium, 3 \u00bd\u20134 hours. Remove from oven, tent with foil, and let rest 30 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, cook bacon in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, 8\u201310 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a small bowl; reserve for another use (it\u2019s the fat you\u2019re after). Add butter pieces to drippings in pan and cook, stirring often, until mixture foams, then browns, 5\u20138 minutes. Strain into a medium nonreactive bowl. Immediately stir in shallot; let cool (butter will have set up but will still be soft). Using an electric mixer on medium-high, add room-temperature butter to bacon fat mixture and beat until light and fluffy. Mix in chives and vinegar; season bacon butter with salt. Chill, stirring occasionally, at least 20 minutes (butter should be a little more firm but still light and fluffy).",
        "Move rack to upper third of oven; increase oven temperature to 500\u00b0F. Roast meat until deep brown and exterior is crisp, 8\u201310 minutes. Serve rib-eye roast with bacon butter.",
        "Bacon butter mixture (without chives and vinegar) can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled. Let soften slightly before adding chives and vinegar."
