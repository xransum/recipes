        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "Add half of the oil to a large saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, cook the onions, bell peppers, jalapeno, olives and\u00a0capers until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and sweat until just aromatic, about a minute. Stir in the tomato paste and deglaze with the red wine. Stir in the tomatoes and bring the pan to medium-high heat. Reduce until the liquid is almost evaporated, about 7 minutes. Fold in the oregano, mixing well. Continue cooking until the stuffing is a thick, pulpy consistency, about 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat.",
        "Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.",
        "Score both sides of the fish. Stuff the cavity of the fish, using about half of the stuffing; set the remaining stuffing aside. Secure with three evenly spaced lengths of kitchen twine.",
        "Bring the remaining oil to medium-high heat in a large, nonstick skillet. Sprinkle the\u00a0fish on both sides, and place in the skillet once the oil begins to smoke lightly. Sear\u00a0until the skin browns on the bottom,\u00a03 to 4 minutes. Using a fish spatula, flip the fish gently, and then place the whole skillet onto the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the fish is golden brown, the flesh flakes easily and the stuffing is hot throughout,\u00a012 to 15 minutes. Remove from the skillet and place onto platter with the julienned bell peppers and jicama, if desired.",
        "Put the skillet back over medium-high heat and add the remaining stuffing. Deglaze the pan with the vermouth and stir to combine. Cook for about 1 minute. Remove the kitchen twine from the fish. Garnish the fish with the crispy tortilla strips, the stuffing and a squeeze of lime juice.",
        "To serve: Transfer portions to plates. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with a nice, cold Mexican beer."
