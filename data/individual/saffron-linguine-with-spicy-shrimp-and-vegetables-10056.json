Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil, onion, garlic, remaining 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until onion is softened. In a bowl whisk together tomato paste and chicken broth and add to skillet with fennel and bell pepper. Simmer mixture, covered, until fennel is tender, about 10 minutes.",
        "In a very small bowl or ramekin combine hot water and saffron.",
