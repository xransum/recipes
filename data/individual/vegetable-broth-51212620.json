Add the thyme, peppercorns, coriander, and 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and gently simmer for about an hour.",
        "Pass the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a container, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. The broth will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days; it can be frozen for up to 3 months."
