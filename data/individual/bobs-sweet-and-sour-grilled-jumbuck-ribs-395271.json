        "Heat a cooker to medium to medium-high. Rub the ribs all over with the olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.",
        "To make the glaze, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, and soy sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, brown sugar, and ginger and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the lime juice, cilantro, and mint. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "Oil the grate and place the ribs on it bone side down over direct heat. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, then turn and cook for 5 to 7 minutes more. Repeat the process for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the ribs are pull-apart tender. Move the ribs away from direct heat and glaze the bone side with sauce, then turn and glaze the meat side. Cook for 10 minutes. Repeat one or two more times, if desired.",
        "Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut the ribs into individual pieces and serve."
