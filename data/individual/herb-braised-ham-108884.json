        "Put ham in deep 10- to 20-quart pot and cover with cold water (don't worry if bone sticks out). Bring to a boil, then drain ham.",
        "Put oven rack in lower third of oven (remove any other racks) and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Wash leeks in a bowl of cold water, then lift out and drain well. Cook leeks, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme sprigs, parsley stems, nutmeg, peppercorns, and cloves in 2 tablespoons butter in wide 7- to 10-quart heavy pot (see \"special equipment,\" above) over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil, then add ham, skin side down, and water (liquid will not cover ham) and return to a boil.",
        "Cover pot tightly with lid or, if ham sticks up over top of pot, with heavy-duty foil. Braise ham in oven 1 hour.",
        "Turn ham skin side up and continue to braise in oven, covered, until thermometer inserted into center of ham (do not touch bone) registers 120\u00b0F, about 1 hour more (if ham was labeled \"fully cooked\"), or 160\u00b0F, about 2 hours more (if ham was labeled \"partially cooked\").",
        "While ham braises, mash together flour and remaining 3 tablespoons butter with a fork to make a beurre mani\u00e9.",
        "Transfer ham to a platter and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 45 minutes.",
        "While ham stands, pour braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 3-quart saucepan, pressing on and discarding solids, and skim off any fat. Bring braising liquid to a simmer and whisk in beurre mani\u00e9 1/2 tablespoon at a time (sauce will become lumpy). Continue to simmer, whisking, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chopped thyme and parsley.",
        "Remove skin from ham, then slice meat and serve with sauce."
