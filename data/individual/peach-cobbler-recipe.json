        "Place the dough on a floured surface and knead it into a 13-inch-by-9-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick and place over the peach filling. Use egg white as a wash, brushing on top of dough. Sprinkle the 11/2-tablespoons of sugar on top. Cook the cobbler until the top is golden brown, about 40 minutes."
