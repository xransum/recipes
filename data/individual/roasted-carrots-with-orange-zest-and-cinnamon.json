        "Preheat an oven to 400\u00b0F.",
        "Cut the carrots into 2-inch lengths; halve lengthwise any thick top portions so all the pieces will cook evenly. In a shallow, 9-by-13-inch baking dish, combine the carrots, garlic and orange zest. Drizzle the vegetables with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Add the cinnamon stick, toss to coat the vegetables evenly and spread in an even layer in the dish.",
        "Roast the carrots, stirring every 10 minutes, until tender and lightly browned, about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Sprinkle the carrots with the lemon juice and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
