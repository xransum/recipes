        "Stir warm water and honey together in a large bowl. Mix yeast into the warm water and let stand until the yeast begins to bubble, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir flour, salt, baking soda, and milk into yeast mixture. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat an electric griddle to medium-low heat (220 degrees F/105 degrees C) and grease the griddle. Grease the metal rings.",
        "Place the greased rings onto the griddle and allow to warm for 1 to 2 minutes; spoon about 3 tablespoons of batter into each ring. Batter will be elastic and stringy, but will fill out the ring as it cooks. Cook the crumpets until golden brown on the bottom and bubbles form on the top side, 5 to 8 minutes. Increase griddle temperature to 230 degrees F (110 degrees C) and flip the crumpets. Cook until underside is golden brown, 2 to 3 more minutes.",
        "Remove rings from crumpets, grease the rings and griddle again, and turn griddle heat back down to 220 degrees F (105 degrees C). Repeat to make 2 more batches of crumpets."
