        "Combine the ginger, 3 tablespoons of the honey and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Let sit until cooled to room temperature. Strain, discarding the ginger. Stir in the lime juice.",
        "Meanwhile, cut the watermelon crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Cut off the skin, leaving each slice a square or rectangle. Cut each slice again until you have twenty-four 1-inch cubes. (You will have watermelon left over.) Put the cubes in an 8 by 8-inch baking pan. Pour the cooled syrup over the watermelon and let sit, refrigerated, 1 to 4 hours, turning the cubes halfway through.",
        "Just before serving, mix the cream cheese and the remaining 1 tablespoon honey in a small bowl until smooth. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Push the mixture towards one corner of the bag and twist the top to make a handle. Use scissors to snip a small hole at the corner.",
        "Remove the watermelon from the liquid and transfer the cubes to a serving tray. Pipe a small dollop of the cream cheese mixture onto the top of each cube. Sprinkle the lime zest over the tops of the cubes."
