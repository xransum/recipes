        "Roll each pizza dough half into circles the size of your cast-iron pan. The dough will probably be slightly thicker than what you're used to.",
        "Heat the pan to medium and add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add 1 piece of the rolled-out dough. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is bubbly on top and browned underneath. Flip, add half of the sauce, half of the mozzarella, half of the ham, and half of the pineapple. Cook another 2 minutes, until the bottom is cooked, then slip under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cheese looks bubbly and the pineapple is slightly caramelized. Top with basil. Remove the pizza from the pan, and repeat with the other piece of dough."
