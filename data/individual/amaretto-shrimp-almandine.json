        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.",
        "Place flour in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt. Pat shrimp dry with a paper towel. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until bubbling. Dredge the shrimp in the flour a few at a time, and place in the skillet. Work as quickly as possible, as the shrimp will cook very quickly. Cook shrimp only part way, about 1 or 2 minutes. Remove to a paper towel lined dish, and set aside.",
        "Stir in the honey and almonds, return to a simmer, and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Very carefully pour in the Amaretto. Light a match, or even better, a long wooden skewer. Holding your hand away from the flame and to the side of the pan, ignite the Amaretto. This will quickly burn off the alcohol and speed the reduction process. Lightly boil for 2 minutes to reduce.",
        "Return the shrimp and pasta to the skillet, and toss together until heated through."
