        "Into a bowl sift together the flour and the cocoa powder. In a small heavy saucepan combine the butter, the water, the granulated sugar, and a pinch of salt and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring until the butter is melted. Reduce the heat to moderate, add the flour mixture, and cook the mixture, beating it with a wooden spoon, until it pulls away from the side of the pan, forming a ball. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and with an electric mixer at high speed beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Drop the mixture by rounded tablespoons onto a buttered baking sheet, forming 12 mounds, baking the profiteroles in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are puffed and crisp, and let them cool on a rack. The profiteroles may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container. Reheat the profiteroles on a baking sheet in a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 5 minutes, or until they are crisp, and let them cool on the rack.",
        "In a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water melt the chocolate with the water and the cream, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and stir in the kahl\u00fba. The sauce may be made 1 week in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated. Makes about 1 cup.",
        "With a serrated knife cut each profiterole in half crosswise, discard any uncooked dough from the centers, and sandwich a small scoop (about 1 1/2 inch in diameter) of the ice cream between the top and bottom of each profiterole. Sprinkle the profiteroles with the confectioners' sugar, pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce onto each of 4 dessert plates, and arrange 3 profiteroles on each plate."
