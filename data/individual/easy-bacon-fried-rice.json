        "Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until  just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Drain all but 1 to 2 teaspoons of bacon grease from the skillet. Add green beans, onion, and garlic; saute until bacon is crisp and green beans and onions are softened, about 3 minutes.",
        "Push bacon mixture to one side of the skillet; heat sesame oil on the empty side, about 30 seconds. Pour in egg; cook until just set, about 1 minute. Stir into bacon mixture to combine. Mix in rice. Stir in soy sauce, a tablespoon at a time, until rice is evenly coated. Cook until rice is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes."
