        "Pat scallops dry completely. Toss the scallops and 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce together in a bowl. In a medium nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, add the scallops and cook until opaque in color, turning occasionally. Remove the scallops. In another small saute pan over medium-high heat, add the bean sprouts. Add the remaining hoisin sauce and saute the bean sprouts until they are warmed through, but still crispy. Remove the sprouts and let cool.",
        "Place the pliable spring roll wrappers on a clean surface. Divide the scallions, carrots, zucchini, and crab meat evenly among the wrappers. Fold the sides in, then roll the wrapper up, like a burrito, so the filling can't fall out. Serve the spring rolls with the Tropical Fruit Salad.",
        "Mix the papaya, mango, lemon juice, ginger, and honey in a bowl. Toss to combine well. Garnish with cilantro."
