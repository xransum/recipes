        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Remove the pork chops from the marinade directly to the grill. Discard the marinade.",
        "Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)."
