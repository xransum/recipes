        "Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface, fit it into 8 tartlet tins, each 3 3/4 inches across the top and 3/4 inch deep, and roll a rolling pin over the edges of the tins to trim the excess dough. Chill the shells for 30 minutes.",
        "In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and beat in the buttermilk, the cornmeal, the grated zest, the lemon juice, and the salt. Divide the mixture among the tartlet shells and bake the tartlets on a baking sheet in the lower third of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. and bake the tartlets for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until they are golden and set. Let the tartlets cool in the tins on racks until they can be handled, remove them from the tins, and let them cool completely on the racks. The tartlets may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered loosely in a cool place. Dust the tartlets lightly with the confectioners' sugar and garnish them with the lemon zest knots."
