        "Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season the chicken generously all over with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the 2 Tbs. olive oil. Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the chicken and sear, turning as needed, until golden brown, about 8 minutes total. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",
        "Pour off most of the fat from the pan and return it to medium-high heat. Add the onion and bay leaves and saut\u00e9 until the onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tarragon, the 1/2 tsp. salt and several grinds of pepper. Pour in the wine and stock and stir to dislodge any browned bits from the pan bottom. Transfer the contents of the pan to a slow cooker and stack the chicken on top. Cover and cook on low according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the chicken is tender, about 3 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, make the tapenade: In a food processor, combine the green olives, black olives, figs, garlic, olive oil, brandy, lemon zest and rosemary and pulse to form a chunky tapenade.",
        "Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Strain the braising liquid into a small saucepan, let stand for a few minutes and then skim away the fat with a large spoon. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until reduced by about half to concentrate the flavors, about 10 minutes.",
        "In a bowl, drizzle the arugula with a little olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss. Divide the chicken among warmed plates and drizzle with the braising liquid. Top each portion with a large spoonful of tapenade and some of the arugula. Serve immediately. Serves 6.",
