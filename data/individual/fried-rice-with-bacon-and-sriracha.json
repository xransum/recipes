        "Mix corn, peas, and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until tender, about 2 minutes.",
        "Whisk 1 tablespoon water and 1 egg together in a small bowl.",
        "Melt butter in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg; cook until set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer cooked egg into to a plate and slice. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons water and remaining 2 eggs.",
        "Place bacon in the wok and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and slice.",
        "Reheat wok over high heat, about 1 minute. Swirl in oil; heat until it shimmers. Break up large clumps of rice with wet fingers to separate the grains. Add 2 handfuls of rice to the wok and cook, stirring constantly, until it stars to crisp up, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining rice.",
        "Reduce heat to medium; return all rice to the wok. Stir in sriracha sauce, soy sauce, and fish sauce until rice is well-coated and heated through, about 2 minutes. Add corn, peas, eggs, and bacon; toss together until combined, about 3 minutes."
