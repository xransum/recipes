        "Using small sharp knife and starting at top of inward curve just below tail, butterfly shrimp, cutting each more than halfway through toward outward curve (do not cut shrimp in two). Open each shrimp (as for book) and press slightly to flatten. Mix cornstarch, salt and cayenne in medium bowl. Place coconut in pie dish. Beat egg whites in another medium bowl until frothy. Dredge shrimp in cornstarch mixture; shake off excess. Dip shrimp into egg whites, then press shrimp into coconut; turn shrimp over and press into coconut again to coat both sides.",
