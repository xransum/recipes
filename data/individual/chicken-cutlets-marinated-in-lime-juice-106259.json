        "Place the chicken in a bowl or shallow dish, add the lime juice, soy sauce, and Maggi sauce, and turn to moisten evenly with the marinade. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning the chicken occasionally.",
        "Remove the chicken from the marinade, drain well, and blot dry with paper towels. Reserve the marinade.",
        "In a skillet large enough to hold the cutlets in one layer, heat the oil over medium-high heat until rippling. Add the chicken and saut\u00e9, turning once, for about 3 minutes per side, or until just cooked through. If desired, transfer the cutlets to a heated platter, add the marinating liquid to the skillet, and boil over high heat for 1 minute. Pour over the chicken. Serve at once, with lime wedges."
