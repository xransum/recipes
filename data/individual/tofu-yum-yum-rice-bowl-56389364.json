        "Place tofu on a rimmed baking sheet layered with paper towels; top with several more paper towels and press gently to squeeze out excess liquid. Transfer tofu to a shallow baking dish.",
        "Give garlic, soy sauce, chili paste, cilantro, and ginger a whirl in a blender, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth, about 3 minutes (consistency will be similar to ketchup). Pour over tofu and turn to coat. Chill at least 2 hours.",
        "Do ahead: Tofu can be marinated 12 hours ahead. Cover and keep chilled.",
        "Place rice in a sieve and rinse under cold running water, rubbing with your fingers, until water runs clear. (This yields fluffy grains that won't clump.) Let drain 5 minutes.",
        "Transfer rice to a medium saucepan; cover with 3 cups water and season with salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 12\u201315 minutes.",
        "Remove saucepan from heat and fluff rice with a fork. Cover with a kitchen towel, then replace lid. Let sit 10 minutes for steam to absorb.",
        "Pour oil into a medium pot to a depth of 2\" and fit pot with thermometer. Heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0.",
        "Place cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Working in batches, remove tofu from marinade (do not scrape it off) and toss in cornstarch; shake off excess. Working in batches, fry tofu, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; let drain.",
        "Divide rice among bowls. Make a small well in the center of each and nestle a poached egg inside. Top with fried tofu, then kimchi, cilantro, basil, scallions, peanuts, and sesame seeds."
