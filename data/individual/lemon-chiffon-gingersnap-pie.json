        "Preheat an oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).",
        "In a bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs, butter and the 3 Tbs. granulated sugar until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Pat the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom and all the way up the sides of a 9-inch (23-cm) pie dish. Bake until the crust is firm, 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Pour the cold water into a saucepan and sprinkle with the gelatin. Let stand until the gelatin softens and swells, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the salt, lemon juice, orange zest and egg yolks; the mixture will be lumpy. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the gelatin melts and the mixture thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil. Set the saucepan in an ice bath until the mixture is cool to the touch.",
        "In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the cream and confectioners\u2019 sugar on medium-high speed until thick, soft peaks form. Spoon the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture and fold together with a rubber spatula until smooth. Pour into the prepared crust, smoothing the top.",
        "Refrigerate the pie until chilled and firm, 3 to 4 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving. Serves 6 to 8.",
