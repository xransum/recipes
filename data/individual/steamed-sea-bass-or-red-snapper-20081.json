        "Scale and clean fish. Keep the head and tail on if you want to serve the fish real Chinese style. Be sure fish is at room temperature. Cut slashes on 45 angle at inch intervals on both sides. Rub the fish both inside and outside with salt. Cut ham, bamboo shoot, scallions and ginger into fine shreds. Place fish on a serving plate or Pyrex plate. Spread tung ku, bamboo shoot , scallion, ginger and ham shreds over fish. Mix sherry with 1 tablespoon tung ku liquid and pour over fish. Steam over vigorously boiling water for 10 minutes. Test the meat in slashes. If meat flakes from the bone, it's done. Otherwise steam 5 more minutes. Garnish with Chinese parsley."
