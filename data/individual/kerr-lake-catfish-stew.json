        "Place the bacon in a Dutch oven or a large pot with a lid; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Reserving the drippings in the skillet, remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Crumble the bacon and set aside.",
        "Put the onions in the pot; cover and allow to cook about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes, tomato sauce, potatoes, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce into the onions. Season with salt and pepper; allow to simmer 30 minutes. Stir the crumbled bacon and catfish into the mixture; continue cooking until the fish flakes easily, about 10 minutes more."
