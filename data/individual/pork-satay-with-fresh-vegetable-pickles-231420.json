        "Mix first 8 ingredients in medium bowl. Season sauce to taste with pepper. Place 1 pork piece on work surface. Press slightly to flatten. Using sharp knife, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Repeat with remaining pork, forming 30 pork scallops (reserve any remaining pork for another use). Thread 5 scallops onto each of six 11-inch-long metal skewers. Arrange skewers on rimmed baking sheet. Transfer 1/3 cup sauce to small bowl; reserve. Brush remaining sauce over both sides of pork. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover pork and reserved sauce separately; chill.)",
