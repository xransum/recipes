        "Individually wrap the 4 sections of baguette in aluminum foil and set in the oven to warm, about 10 minutes. Trim the fennel bulb of any fronds or stalks and remove a slice or two from the root end. Using a mandoline, a sharp knife, or a food processor, shave the fennel as thin as possible \u2014the shavings should be nearly transparent. Toss the fennel with the lemon juice, olive oil, a pinch of salt, and some pepper. Set aside.",
        "Remove one of the baguette sections from the oven. Spread the bottom half with a tablespoon or so of the olive paste. Lay on top 2 to 4 slices of preserved lemon, if using. Arrange one fourth of the tuna on the sandwich. Dot with some of the harissa, and top with a scattering of the fennel salad. Close the sandwich and wrap up again with foil. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining bread to form 4 sandwiches. Cut each in half through the foil and serve.",
        "Leftovers: Assembled sandwiches will keep for eight hours or so, but no more. As they sit, the bread gets a little soggy, but that isn't such a bad thing."
