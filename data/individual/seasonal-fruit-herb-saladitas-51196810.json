        "Nectarine-Thyme Saladita\nPit and slice a perfectly ripe nectarine, then cut the slices in half. Toss in about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves, stripped from the stems with your fingers. Serve right away\u2014plain, or with a cruet of extra-virgin olive oil and a wedge of lime.\nCantaloupe-Basil Saladita\nPeel and seed a small, ripe cantaloupe. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch dice or even smaller and place it in a bowl. Shortly before serving, add about a dozen minced fresh basil leaves and serve soon thereafter.",
        "Apple-Parsley Saladita\nCore and chop a crisp apple or two and toss with a small splash of fresh lemon juice or cider vinegar. Throw in a handful of minced fresh flat-leaf parsley. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil.",
        "Pomegranate-Mint Saladita\nExtract the seeds from a large pomegranate and place them in a bowl. Shortly before serving, toss with about 25 minced fresh mint leaves and serve pronto. I highly recommend Pickled Red Onions as an accompaniment.",
        "Mango-Cilantro Saladita\nPeel, pit, and cut 2 fresh mangoes (or 2 cups frozen mango chunks) into 1/4-inch dice and splash with up to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice. Just before serving, toss with a handful or two of cilantro, minced, and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, if you like. Serve right away. It's great with Pickled Red Onions."
