        "In a medium bowl, stir together eggs and sugar until smooth; set aside.  In the top of a double boiler over simmering water, heat cream until bubbles start to form at edges.  Remove from heat and whisk into egg mixture, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.  Return mixture to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Cook 2 minutes more, then remove from heat.   Cool completely.  Stir in vanilla.",
