        "In a kettle bring 10 cups water to a boil, stir in the barley and the salt, and simmer the barley, covered, for 40 minutes, or until it is tender. Drain the barley in a colander, rinse it under cold water, and drain it well. In a blender blend the vinegar, the basil, the oil, and salt to taste until the dressing is emulsified. In a very large bowl toss the barley with the dressing and the corn and stir in the tomatoes gently. Chill the salad, covered, for 1 hour. The salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled."
