        "Mince garlic and mash to a paste with 1 teaspoon salt using a large heavy knife, then stir together garlic paste, rosemary, pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Pat pork dry and rub all over with paste. Marinate, uncovered, at room temperature 20 minutes.",
        "While pork marinates, prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.",
        "While grill is heating, set a box grater into a shallow dish, then rub cut sides of tomatoes against large teardrop-shaped holes to remove as much tomato pulp as possible (discard skins). Boil tomato pulp, sugar, red pepper flakes, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 4-quart heavy pot, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer tomato jam to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool to room temperature, stirring.",
        "Brush both sides of endive halves with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and season with salt. Grill pork and endives on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over occasionally, until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of pork registers 150\u00b0F and endives are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes. (Internal temperature will rise to about 155\u00b0F while standing.) Serve pork with endives and tomato chile jam."
