        "Pat steaks dry between paper towels and season with salt and pepper. In a heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown steaks. Transfer steaks with tongs to a plate and in drippings remaining in skillet cook onion over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in zest and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, soy sauce, and steaks and simmer, uncovered, until steaks are tender, about 5 minutes."
