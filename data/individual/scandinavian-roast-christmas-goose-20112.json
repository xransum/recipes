        "Wash goose inside and out with hot water and dry carefully. Rub inside with salt. Combine apples and prunes and stuff goose. Truss and tie legs loosely to the tail. Place goose on rack in roasting pan. Roast in 425\u00b0F. oven for 30 minutes. Remove goose and turn heat down to 350\u00b0F. Drain all fat from pan. Sprinkle goose with a little of the flour. Return goose to oven.",
        "Combine butter and hot water. When the flour on the goose has begun to brown, start basting with water-butter liquid. Sprinkle a little more flour on the goose after each basting; this helps absorb fat. Baste frequently. Roast for about 16-20 minutes per pound, depending on age of the bird, timing from the moment the goose goes in the oven. If goose os very fat, drain off fat several times during roasting. After the first hour, turn the bird every half hour, roasting the goose on its back for the last 15 minutes. Test for doneness by moving legs up and down; they should move easily. Place goose on heated platter. Surround with thick slices of fried apple. Place a plumped pitted prune on each apple slice. Serve with red cabbage and sugar-browned potatoes."
