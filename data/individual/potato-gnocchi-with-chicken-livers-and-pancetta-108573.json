        "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Pierce potato in several places with fork. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Let stand until just cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Peel potato. Press potato through ricer or food mill or mash in large bowl. Add flour, egg, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon peel, salt, and pepper and stir just until blended. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; divide into 8 pieces. Roll 1 dough piece between hands and surface to 15-inch-long rope. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place gnocchi on lightly floured baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)",

Add crimini mushrooms; saut\u00e9 until soft, about 5 minutes. Add porcini mushrooms and their soaking liquid, leaving behind any sediment in bowl. Cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 1 minute. Add broth and vinegar. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until reduced to 1 cup liquid, about 4 minutes. Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter.",
        "Heat heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta; saut\u00e9 until pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes. Add shallots, parsley, sage, and rosemary. Saut\u00e9 until shallots are soft, about 5 minutes. Add liver and saut\u00e9 just until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add mushroom mixture. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.",
        "Meanwhile, bring large pot of salted water to boil. Add gnocchi and cook until rising to surface, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking 1 minute longer. Drain. Divide gnocchi among 4 plates. Spoon sauce over and serve.",
