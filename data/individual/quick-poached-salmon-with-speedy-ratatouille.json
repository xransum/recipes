        "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, ready to poach the salmon.",
        "Meanwhile, melt the coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium to high heat. Add the onion, zucchini and eggplant and stir-fry for about 4 minutes or until they are just starting to soften and color.",
        "Drop in the thyme and stir for another minute, then add the tomato paste and mix to coat the vegetables. Keep frying, stirring continuously, for about 45 seconds before pouring in the balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let the ratatouille bubble away for about 10 minutes, or just until the vegetables are soft. If it seems to be getting too thick, add another 1/4 cup or so of water.",
        "While the veggies are simmering away, slide the salmon fillets into the boiling water. Bring back to a simmer, then cook the fish for 10 minutes, or until just cooked through.",
        "Using a slotted spoon, carefully lift the fish out of the water and drain well. Serve up your yummy ratatouille topped with the juicy salmon."
