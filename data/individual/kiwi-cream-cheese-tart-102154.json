        "Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1 tablespoon ice water and blend until moist clumps form.

Press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Freeze crust 20 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake crust until sides begin to set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake crust until cooked through and pale golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer. Cool crust completely.",

Fold into cream cheese mixture. Spoon filling into crust; smooth top with knife. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.",
