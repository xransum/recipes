        "In a large bowl, combine the harissa, Aleppo chili, sesame seeds and the 1 tsp. salt. Add the potatoes and stir to coat well.",
        "When the roasting pan is hot, remove it from the oven and carefully add the potatoes, stirring gently to coat them with the oil. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer in the pan. Roast until the undersides are nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Using a metal spatula, flip the potatoes over and roast until they are tender inside and browned and crisp outside, about 15 minutes more.",
        "Meanwhile, put the yogurt in a small bowl and fold in the mint. Squeeze the juice from the lemon half into the yogurt and stir well. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer the roasted potatoes to a warmed platter and serve immediately with the yogurt sauce for dipping. Serves 4.",
