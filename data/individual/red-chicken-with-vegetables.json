        "Add tomato paste, water and salt and pepper to taste. Stir together, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, during which the 'gravy' should thicken.",
        "Meanwhile, put carrots in a small saucepan; add sugar and cook until carrots are soft to caramelize. When cooked, drain carrots. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat, add carrots and saute. Set aside.",
