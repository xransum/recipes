        "Cut the steak in half lengthwise. Cut the halves against the grain into slices about 1/8 inch thick. In a small bowl, toss together the beef, the 1 1/2 tsp. soy sauce, the 1 1/2 tsp. peanut oil and the oyster sauce. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.",
        "In a large, heavy fry pan over high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the peanut oil. Add the beef and sear for 1 minute without stirring, then stir-fry the beef until the meat is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Return the pan to high heat and warm the remaining 2 Tbs. peanut oil. Add the sweet potato and dried chilies, season with salt and sear for 1 minute without stirring. Add the green onions and stir-fry until the potatoes are just tender, about 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute more. Return the beef to the pan and stir-fry until heated through.",
        "Transfer to a large platter and garnish with cilantro. Serve immediately with white rice and soy sauce. Serves 2 to 4.",
