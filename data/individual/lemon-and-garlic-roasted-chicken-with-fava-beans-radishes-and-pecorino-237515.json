        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place chickens on rack set in large roasting pan. Starting at each cavity end, slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen, being careful not to tear skin. Arrange lemon slices under skin to cover breast meat.",
        "Season each cavity with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Stuff each with halved lemons, garlic, rosemary, and oregano.",
        "Flip wings of each chicken back and tuck under body. Using pastry brush, brush 3 tablespoons oil over skin of each chicken, then sprinkle each with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Tie legs together loosely with kitchen string.",
        "Roast chickens, basting with pan juices every 15 minutes, until skins are crisp golden-brown and juices run clear when thighs are pierced, about 55 to 60 minutes. (Instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast should register 170\u00b0F.) Remove from oven, then remove lemons, herbs, and garlic from cavities and discard. Reserve pan drippings. Transfer chickens to carving board and tent with foil to keep warm.",
        "In 2-quart pot of boiling water, blanch fresh fava beans 1 minute. Drain, then immediately transfer to medium bowl of ice water to stop cooking. Drain. Slip outer skin off each bean and discard skin; place beans in medium bowl. Add radishes, arugula, mint, parsley, celery leaves, and cheese, and toss to combine. Stir in lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.",
        "Divide fava bean and radish salad among 10 plates. Carve chickens and arrange pieces atop each portion of salad. Spoon pan drippings over."
