        "Place a granite pizza stone on a cold grill, cover the grill, and preheat over medium heat until the internal temperature of the grill registers 475\u00b0 to 500\u00b0F, about 20 minutes.",
        "On a floured work surface, roll out the pizza dough into a 10-inch round about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour as needed. Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour and lay the dough on top. Spread the tomato sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the tomato sauce. Top with the salami, onion, olives, goat cheese and oregano.",
        "Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone, cover the grill, and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Using the pizza peel, transfer the pizza to a cutting board and cut into slices. Serve immediately. Makes one 10-inch pizza; serves 2.",
