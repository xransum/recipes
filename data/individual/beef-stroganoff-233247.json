        "To get perfectly even-sized pieces of meat, it is best to cut it yourself. Cut the beef tenderloin across into 3in (7.5cm) pieces, then cut each piece against the grain into slices about 3in (7.5cm) square and 1in (2.5cm) thick. Lay the slices flat and cut the squares into 3 by 1in (7.5 by 2.5cm) strips.",
        "1. Heat the oil and half of the butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat and fry the onions until translucent. Add the mushrooms and fry until they begin to soften, 2-3 minutes. Remove the onions and mushrooms from the pan with a slotted spoon.",
        "2. Add the rest of the butter to the pan and heat until beginning to foam. Add the steak and saut\u00e9 quickly over a high heat until browned on all sides, 3-4 minutes.",
        "3. Return the onions and mushrooms to the pan, and stir and shake to mix with the meat. Sprinkle with the parsley, then pour in the cream and cook for 1 minute longer. Season well before serving."
