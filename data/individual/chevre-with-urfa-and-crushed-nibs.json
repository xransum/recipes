        "Place the goat cheese into a bowl, and set aside to reach room temperature, about 30 minutes. Mix in the Urfa biber until thoroughly combined. Scoop the goat cheese out onto a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface, and fold the plastic over the cheese to form the cheese back into a log shape. Twist the ends of the plastic, and chill the goat cheese log thoroughly for at least 1 hour.",
        "Place cocoa nibs onto a large, flat plate, and unroll the goat cheese log onto the nibs, turning the cheese to coat the surface. Rewrap the cheese in plastic wrap, keeping the log shape, and chill until firm, about 1 more hour.",
        "Bring to room temperature before serving."
