        "Fold Swiss chard leaves in half lengthwise and cut stalks away from leaves. Cut leaves coarsely into 1-inch pieces. Slice stalks thinly crosswise. Reserve stalks and leaves separately. Cook chopped leaves in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 1 minute. Drain and reserve.",
        "Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Add sliced stalks; saut\u00e9 until starting to soften, about 8 minutes.",
        "Add onion and next 3 ingredients; saut\u00e9 3 minutes. Add drained tomatoes and 1 cup raisins. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.",
