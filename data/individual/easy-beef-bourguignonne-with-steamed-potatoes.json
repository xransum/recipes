        "Generously season the beef with salt and pepper.",
        "In a large fry pan or the flameproof insert of a slow cooker over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the bacon and cook until browned but not crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Pour off all but 1 Tbs. fat from the pan or slow cooker insert.",
        "Working in batches, brown the beef on all sides. Transfer all the beef and bacon to a slow cooker insert and transfer the insert to the slow cooker base. Add the braising sauce, cover and cook on high for 4 hours. Uncover, add the pearl onions and carrots, and re-cover. Continue cooking until the meat is fork-tender and the vegetables are tender but not mushy, about 1 hour more.",
        "About 30 minutes before the beef is done cooking, using a steamer pot, steam the potatoes until tender when pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the butter and 1 Tbs. of the parsley to the potatoes and toss to combine. Season with salt.",
        "Skim the fat from the braising liquid. Transfer the beef bourguignonne to shallow bowls and garnish with the remaining 1 Tbs. parsley. Serve immediately with the steamed potatoes. Serves 6.",
