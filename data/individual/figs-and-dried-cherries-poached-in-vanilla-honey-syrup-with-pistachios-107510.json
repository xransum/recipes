        "Combine 2 cups water and sugar in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Stir in honey. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Add figs and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Add dried tart cherries; cover and simmer until figs and dried cherries are tender, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer fig mixture to bowl. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (Fig mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Discard vanilla bean. Divide fig mixture among 6 bowls. Top each serving with dollop of yogurt, if desired. Sprinkle with pistachios."
