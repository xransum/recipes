        "Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl until fluffy.  Add egg yolks one at a time, blending well between additions.  Sift the flour, baking soda, and baking powder into the egg mixture; fold gently to mix.  Stir in the poppy seeds, milk, and vanilla extract.  Gently fold in the beaten egg whites until just incorporated.",
        "Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan.  Sprinkle in the chocolate chips and cinnamon sugar.  Pour the remaining batter over top, and sprinkle with additional cinnamon sugar.  With a knife, lightly swirl in the chocolate chips and cinnamon sugar so they are dispersed throughout the cake.",
