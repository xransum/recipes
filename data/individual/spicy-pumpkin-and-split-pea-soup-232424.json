        "In a large metal spoon or a small pan, heat saffron over low heat about 10 seconds until dry, then grind to a powder with the back of a spoon and steep in 1 tbsp boiling water to release flavor, about 1 minute. Bring broth, peas, and onion to a boil in a large soup pot over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in oil, cinnamon, ginger, spoonful of saffron, and pumpkin. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. The soup is done when the pumpkin begins to fall apart and the peas are tender. Salt and pepper and sprinkle with parsley."
