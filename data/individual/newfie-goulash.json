        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes; stir in the green pepper, and cook until tender, about 8 more minutes. Mash the corned beef into the pot, and simmer until hot. Mix in the tomato soup, ketchup, cooked macaroni, salt and black pepper; stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top, and serve."
