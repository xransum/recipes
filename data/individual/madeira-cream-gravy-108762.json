        "Heat 3 tablespoons reserved turkey fat (if you have less, use butter to make up difference) in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, then add flour and cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes. Add hot stock in a fast stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, whisking, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, 5 minutes.
