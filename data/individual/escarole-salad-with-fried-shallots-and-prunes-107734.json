        "Heat oil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry shallots in 3 batches, stirring frequently and being careful not to burn, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer shallots as browned with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Shallots will crisp as they cool.) Transfer 3 tablespoons shallot oil from pan to a cup for dressing and reserve remainder for another use.",
