Pour off and discard all but about 3 tablespoons of the oil and in the remaining oil cook the onion and the mushrooms over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is golden. Add the garlic and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with the juice, the wine, the chicken with any juices that have accumulated in the bowl, the anchovy paste, and the or\u00e9gano and simmer the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. The chicken mixture may be made 2 days in advance, cooled to room temperature, and kept covered and chilled. Reheat the chicken mixture before serving.",
