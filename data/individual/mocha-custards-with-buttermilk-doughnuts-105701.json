        "Place six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins in roasting pan. Divide chocolate mixture among cups. Fill roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of cups. Cover pan with foil and bake until custards are set, about 45 minutes. Remove custards from water. Cool, then cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Serve each custard with 1 buttermilk doughnut."
