        "1 1/2 cups fruit and vegetable pulp leftover from a juicer (We used 1 cup berry/apple and 1/2 cup carrot, but any combination will work here. See Cook's Note)",

        "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cardamom if using.",

        "Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until the pan is cool enough to handle, then unmold the bread onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing."
