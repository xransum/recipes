        "In a blender pur\u00e9e the bell pepper with the lemon juice, the sugar, the cayenne, the oil, and salt and black pepper to taste until the sauce is smooth. In a small bowl whisk together the garlic paste, the ginger, and the mustard and spread the mixture onto both sides of the chicken. In separate bowls have ready the seasoned flour, the egg wash, and the coconut. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip it in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, and coat it thoroughly with the coconut, pressing the coconut to make it adhere.",
        "In a large ovenproof skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it saut\u00e9 the chicken for 2 minutes on each side, or until the coconut is golden. Add the Sherry, transfer the skillet to a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven, and bake the chicken for 10 to 12 minutes, or until it is just cooked through. Divide the sauce between 2 large plates and arrange the chicken on it.",
        "Using a long-handled fork char the peppers over an open flame, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the skins are blackened. (Or broil the peppers on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat, turning them every 5 minutes, for 15 to 25 minutes, or until the skins are blistered and charred.) Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them steam, covered, until they are cool enough to handle. keeping the peppers whole, peel them starting at the blossom end, cut off the tops, and discard the seeds and ribs. (Wear rubber gloves when handling chilies.)"
