        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.",
        "In a bowl combine the dry ingredients and blend thoroughly. Cream in the butter with your fingers or a fork, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk a little at a time and, using your hands or a fork, work it in just until it's thoroughly incorporated and you have a smooth ball of dough. Don't overwork or over-handle the dough.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, press the dough out into a round that is about 1-inch thick. Using a round cookie cutter or the rim of a drinking glass, press out (2 1/2-inch) rounds; you should get about 7 biscuits. If you like, you can re-roll the leftover dough to make more, but the texture of these will be denser than the others.",
        "Place the dough rounds on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with heavy cream. Grind fresh pepper over top of biscuits, if desired. Bake until golden on top and brown on the bottom, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with butter and a drizzle of honey."
