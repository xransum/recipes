        "Combine the carrots, stock and thyme in a pot. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
        "Remove from the heat and transfer the soup in two batches to a blender (or you may use an immersion blender). Puree the soup completely, and then stir in the honey and cream. Taste, and then add salt and pepper as needed. Use a little warm broth if the soup needs thinning.",
        "Serve while warm with a few thyme leaves on top.",
        "To freeze: Allow the soup to cool, ladle into freezer-proof quart or pint containers with lids and place in the freezer.",
        "To thaw and cook: Place the soup container in the refrigerator for 24 hours to slowly thaw, or place it in a bowl of cool water for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Heat the thawed soup in a sauce pan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 15 minutes."
