        "For medium-rare, set the Sous Vide Professional to 138\u00b0F (59\u00b0C), with the rear pump flow switch closed and the front flow switch set to fully open.",
        "Season the beef filets with salt and pepper. Place each filet in a small vacuum bag with 1 Tbs. butter, a shallot half and a thyme sprig.",
        "Seal the bags to the desired vacuum; for beef, 90% to 95% vacuum is desirable.",
        "Once the target temperature of 138\u00b0F (59\u00b0C) is reached, place the bags in the circulating water bath.",
        "Cook the beef to the desired doneness, about 60 minutes. You can hold the beef at this temperature for up to 90 minutes without affecting the quality or texture. For medium-rare beef, the internal temperature should register 138\u00b0F (59\u00b0C).",
        "Remove the bags from the circulating water and remove the beef filets from the bags. Pat the filets dry with paper towels and lightly season with salt and pepper.",
        "In a hot pan, grill or plancha, warm olive oil or butter. Add the filets and quickly sear until browned on both sides. Transfer the filets to a cutting board and let rest for 60 seconds. Cut into slices and serve. Serves 4.",
