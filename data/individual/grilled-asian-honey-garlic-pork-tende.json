        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade in the dish. Grill pork, covered, basting occasionally with 1/4 of reserved marinade, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 12 to 15 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest, about 5 minutes.",
