Bring to a boil, then cover, and place into the preheated oven. Bake until the meat has turned from red to light pink in the center, about 30 minutes.",

Return the Dutch oven to the stove, and simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat until the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency, about 10 minutes.
