        "If using wings, cut each wing at joints into 3 pieces. In a stockpot or kettle (at least 6-quart) combine chicken parts with 14 cups water and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Add remaining 1/2 cup water and bring mixture to a simmer, skimming froth.",
        "Stick 2 onion halves with 1 clove each and add to stockpot or kettle with remaining ingredients. Simmer stock, skimming froth, 3 hours.",
        "Pour stock through a fine sieve into a large heatproof bowl. If a more concentrated flavor is desired, in a large saucepan boil stock until reduced to desired concentration. Cool stock, uncovered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week, or frozen in an airtight container, 3 months. Remove fat before using."
