        "In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Stir in the eggs one at a time beating well after each. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, baking soda and baking powder, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally stir in the vanilla, carrots, pineapple and walnuts. Divide batter evenly between the two pans. Don 't worry about filling them too full, as this cake does not rise very much.",
