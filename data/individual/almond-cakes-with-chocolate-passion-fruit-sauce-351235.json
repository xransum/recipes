Transfer to bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, then add butter and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Transfer to rack to cool while making sauce. (Cakes can be baked ahead, removed from ramekins, and frozen, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, up to 1 week. Allow 4 hours for cakes to thaw at room temperature. To rewarm, place on parchment-paper-lined baking sheet and bake at 350\u00b0F for 10 minutes.)",
        "Transfer chopped chocolate to small bowl.",

Transfer cake to rack and sift confectioners' sugar over, then transfer to prepared plate. Unmold remaining cakes in same manner. Serve immediately."
