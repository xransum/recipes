        "Fill a large bowl with cold water. Using a mandoline or a very sharp knife, slice the baking and purple potatoes into 1/8-inch-thick rounds then transfer to the cold water to soak for 5 minutes. While the potatoes soak, slice the beets into 1/8-inch-thick rounds.",
        "Remove the potatoes from the water and transfer them to a paper towel\u2013lined plate, patting them completely dry.",
        "Line a large baking sheet with paper towels. Fill a deep, heavy-bottomed medium saucepan (or deep fryer) with 4 inches of oil, leaving at least 3 inches between the oil and the top of the saucepan. Heat the oil over moderately high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350\u00b0F.",
        "Working in batches, use a slotted metal spoon or spider to carefully place the potato rounds in the hot oil. Fry, flipping as needed, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer as done to the paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet and immediately season with salt. Continue to fry the remaining potatoes, returning the oil to 350\u00b0F between batches.",
        "Once all the potatoes are fried, fry the beets: Working in batches, use a slotted metal spoon or spider to carefully place the beet rounds in the hot oil. Fry, flipping as needed, until they begin to curl around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer as done to the paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet and immediately season with salt. Continue to fry the remaining beet rounds, returning the oil to 350\u00b0F between batches.",
        "In a large bowl, toss together the potato and beet chips, season with additional salt if necessary, and serve. DO AHEAD: Potato and beet chips can be fried ahead and stored in an airtight container for 3 days."
