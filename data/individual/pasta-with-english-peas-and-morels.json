        "Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the 1/2 tsp. salt and the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup (8 fl. oz./250 ml) of the pasta cooking water.",
        "In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the mushrooms and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms absorb the oil, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the peas and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes.",
        "Add the pasta to the pan along with 1/2 cup (4 fl. oz./125 ml) of the reserved cooking water, 3 Tbs. of the cheese, the lemon zest and 1 Tbs. of the basil. Stir to combine. Add more cooking water if needed to achieve the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer the contents of the pan to a serving bowl or individual plates, sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tbs. cheese and 1 Tbs. basil and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
