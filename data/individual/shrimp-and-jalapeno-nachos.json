        "Place a large nonstick pan over high heat. Cook shrimp in the hot pan in a single layer until barely cooked through and pink, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and let shrimp cool.",
        "Preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease the foil.",
        "Lay tortilla chips onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Place 1 shrimp onto each chip. Add 1 slice jalapeno and 1 large pinch pepperjack cheese on top of each shrimp.",
        "Broil under preheated broiler until cheese is melted and chips are lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Watch carefully; chips will burn quickly.",
