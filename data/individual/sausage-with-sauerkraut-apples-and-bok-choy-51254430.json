        "In a large dry skillet over medium heat, lightly toast the caraway seeds until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape out and reserve seeds.",
        "Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Working in two to three batches, sear bok choy on all sides until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per cut side. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper to each batch, and 1 teaspoon oil to sear each subsequent batch of bok choy.",
        "Add 1 teaspoon oil to the skillet and saut\u00e9 apples with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until softened but still holding their shape, 5 to 7 minutes. Reserve apples.",
        "Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and sear sausages on all sides until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add toasted caraway seeds, sauerkraut, and broth. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and simmer until sausages are cooked through (150\u00b0F for pork sausages, 160\u00b0F for poultry sausages), about 10 minutes. Remove cover and fold in reserved bok choy, apples, vinegar, and butter. Cook, tossing, until some of the liquid has evaporated and the bok choy and apples are warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve with mustard for dipping."
