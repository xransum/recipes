        "Bring 4 quarts salted water to a rolling boil in a 5- to 6-quart pot over moderately high heat. Stir in noodles and 1/2 cup cold water. When water returns to a boil, add another 1/2 cup cold water and bring to a boil again, then repeat procedure once more. Test noodles for doneness (soba should be just tender but still firm and chewy throughout). Drain noodles in a colander and rinse well under cold water, then drain again, thoroughly. Toss noodles with sesame oil in a large bowl.",
        "Toss together remaining ingredients in another bowl, then add to noodles and toss again to combine."
