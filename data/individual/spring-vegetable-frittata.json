        "In a 9 1/2-inch (24-cm) saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the green onions and saut\u00e9 until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ham and peas and cook for 1 minute, then pour the egg mixture into the pan. Divide the goat cheese into tablespoon-size pieces and sprinkle on top of the egg mixture.",
        "Transfer the saut\u00e9 pan to the oven and bake until the eggs are puffy and the top is beginning to brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the basil, and serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.",
