        "Pour a quart of boiling water over the tea and steep for 3 hours. Make a syrup of the sugar and 1 cup of cold water by boiling for 10 minutes. Add the mint leaves and infuse for 2 hours or until the tea is ready. Strain tea and syrup and combine with the lemon juice. Serve in 12- or 14-ounce glasses filled with crushed ice. Garnish with lemon slices and mint sprigs and dust the top with powdered sugar. Without the garnish, this brew will keep for several days in the refrigerator."
