        "Clean the grill or grill pan, grease it generously with olive oil (or any vegetable oil), and preheat it over medium heat.",
        "Season the insides and outsides of the fish with salt, then rub them with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.",
        "Grate the zest from 1 of the lemons and 1 of the oranges; squeeze the juice from 1 of the lemons. Combine the zests and the juice and stir. Cut the remaining lemons and oranges into \u00bc inch rounds. Fill the cavity of each fish with the citrus slices and the basil leaves. To the zest-and-juice mixture, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir well, then let the zest sink to the bottom.",
        "Put the fish on the heated, oiled grill, using indirect medium heat, and cook with the lid closed (see Note). After grilling them for about 10 minutes on one side, turn the fish over and cook them for 7 to 10 minutes longer.",
        "While the fish are still hot, spoon the oil and lemon juice mixture over them, leaving the bitter zest behind."
