        "In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Add the onions and cook for 10 minutes until onions have softened.",
        "In a bowl, combine the cooked onions, remaining broth, bread, paprika, egg substitute and salt and pepper. Mix well.",
        "Place mixture inside the cavity of a turkey or place it in a casserole dish. If stuffing is to be baked separately from the turkey, place stuffing in a preheated 350-degree oven and bake for 45 minutes.",
        "Variations include - Herb Stuffing: Add 1 tablespoon mixed chopped sage, rosemary, and parsley. Fruit Stuffing: Add 1/2 cup diced tart apples, washed cranberries, or diced pears. Sweet Stuffing: Add 1 teaspoon allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger. Mushroom Stuffing: Add 1 cup sliced mushrooms (white or wild). Saute with the onions. Cook until mushrooms are soft. Chestnut Stuffing: Add 1 cup roasted chestnuts, peeled (chestnuts are low in fat). To save time, use a jar of water-packed chestnuts (some grocers stock these around the holidays) instead of roasting the chestnuts. Dried Fruit Stuffing: Add 1 cup diced dried apricots, apples, figs, cranberries, or cherries. Corn Bread Stuffing: Replace 3 cups of the whole-grain bread with 3 cups cornbread."
