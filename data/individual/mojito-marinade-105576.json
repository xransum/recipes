        "Mix together the garlic, onions, orange juice, and lime juice in a bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan til just smoking. Now cover up your arms and put some potholder mitts on your hands because you're about to do something that is contrary to good cooking practice but produces great flavor release. Slide the contents of the bowl into the hot oil \u2014 be very careful because the liquid will splatter. Simmer for 5 minutes to soften the onions and garlic. Season the marinade with the rest of the ingredients. Pour everything into a blender or food processor and pulse 3 times to combine. Pour into a plastic container and cool to room temperature; then cover and refrigerate. Mojito Marinade keeps for up to 2 weeks."
