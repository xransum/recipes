Stir in chard leaves; cook and stir until just wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper.",
        "Stir squash, tomatoes, parsley, and thyme into the skillet. Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top before serving."
