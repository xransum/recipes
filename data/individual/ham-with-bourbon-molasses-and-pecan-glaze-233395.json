        "Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 325\u00b0F. Line large roasting pan with heavy-duty foil, leaving overhang on all sides. Trim off skin and all but 1/4 inch fat from ham. Place ham, fat side up, in prepared pan. Roast ham until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F, about 10 minutes per pound or 2 hours 40 minutes for 16-pound ham.",
        "Remove ham from oven; increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0F. Lightly score fat on ham in diamond pattern. Rub glaze thickly over top and sides of ham. Return ham to oven and roast until glaze is deep brown and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Let ham stand at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes. Serve with chutney and spoon bread."
