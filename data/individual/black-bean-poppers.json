        "To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal.",
