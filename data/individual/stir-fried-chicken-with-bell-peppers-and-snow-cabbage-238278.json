        "Cut boneless chicken breast crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then stack slices and cut into matchstick-size strips. Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy; transfer 1 tablespoon to medium bowl (reserve remaining egg white for another use). Add chicken to bowl with egg white. Add soy sauce, 2 teaspoons rice wine, cornstarch, and white pepper; toss to coat. Mix in 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Let stand 15 minutes.",
        "Mix preserved snow cabbage and sugar in small bowl. Heat 14-inch-diameter flat-bottomed wok or heavy 12-inch-diameter skillet over high heat until drop of water added to wok evaporates on contact. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil and swirl to coat wok. Add sliced chicken breast, spreading evenly. Cook without stirring 30 seconds, then stir-fry until sliced chicken is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken slices to plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to wok, then add red and green bell peppers and stir-fry until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in snow cabbage mixture and salt. Return chicken to wok; add remaining 1 tablespoon rice wine and stir-fry until chicken is just cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil into stir-fry and serve."
