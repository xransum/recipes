        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Remove from the oven, and let cool on the sheets until warm; while still warm, drape the wafers over a small bowl or other container. Let cool. Store at room temperature in an airtight container."
