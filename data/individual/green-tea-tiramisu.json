        "Place egg yolks and 2/3 cup sugar in a large bowl. Set bowl over simmering water and whisk constantly until the mixture is pale yellow and thick ribbons fall from the whisk, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in mascarpone cheese until smooth and creamy. Mix in 2 1/4 teaspoons matcha.",
