        "Turn dough out on floured board.  Knead until smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and cover.  Let rise in warm place until double in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Punch dough down.  Turn over, and let rise again for 45 minutes.",

Dip each ball in melted butter, and roll in sugar-nut mixture.  Place in layers in a 10 inch greased tube pan. Sprinkle any remaining sugar-nut mixture or melted butter over the top layer of balls.  Cover pan with waxed paper and a towel, and let dough rise again 45 minutes.",
