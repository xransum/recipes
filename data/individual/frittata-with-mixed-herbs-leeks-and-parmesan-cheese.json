        "In a bowl, whisk the eggs until blended. Whisk in the minced herbs and grated cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "In the deep half of a 10-inch (25-cm) frittata pan over medium heat, melt 1 1/2 Tbs. of the butter. Add the leeks, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the egg mixture and gently stir to distribute the leeks. Cook until the eggs are just beginning to set, about 4 minutes, using a rubber spatula to gently lift the cooked edges and allow the uncooked eggs to flow underneath.",
        "Meanwhile, in the shallow pan over medium heat, melt the remaining 1/2 Tbs. butter. Place the shallow pan upside down on top of the deep pan and flip the frittata into the shallow pan. Cook, covered, for 4 minutes. Remove the deep pan and cook until the eggs are completely set, 2 to 3 minutes more.",
        "Gently shake the pan to loosen the frittata and slide it onto a platter. Garnish with whole herb leaves and shaved cheese. Serves 4 to 6.",
