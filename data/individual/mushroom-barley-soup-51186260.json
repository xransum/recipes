        "Melt the butter in a large, heavy stockpot or Dutch oven over mediumhigh heat. Add the onions and saut\u00e9 until softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add the fresh mushrooms, celery, carrot, and half of the parsley, and saut\u00e9 until the mushrooms are golden and the celery and carrots are beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in the fl our until well blended. Stir in the mushroom soaking liquid, soaked mushrooms, beef broth, and 4 cups of water. Stir in the barley, salt, and pepper to taste.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. If the soup is too thick, add a little more water. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving."
