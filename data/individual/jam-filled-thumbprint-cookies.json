        "Beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla extract. Reduce mixer speed and add flour and salt and mix until just incorporated.",
        "Form dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on prepared baking sheet. Using your thumb, flatten balls slightly to make an indentation in the center of each cookie. Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes or until bottoms are just golden.",
        "Remove baking sheet from oven. Fill each indentation with a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of jam. Bake for an additional 5 to 6 minutes, or until the edges of cookies are lightly golden. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool."
