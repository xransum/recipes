        "1. Place the chard in a large stockpot with the rinse water still clinging to it and set on medium-high heat. When the chard begins to sizzle stir it and cover. Reduce heat to medium and cook until chard is wilted but still has texture and the leaves have turned dark green while the stems have turned a translucent grey, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "2. Heat at least 2 tablespoons of oil with the garlic in a skillet over medium heat and cook until the garlic begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Add the Swiss chard, squeezing out some of the liquid before adding it to the oil. Cook, stirring, until the Swiss chard has wilted entirely and the garlic is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and transfer to a warmed platter. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve."
