        "In a bowl, whisk together the garlic, parsley, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, vinegar and olive oil. Place the steaks in the barrel of an electric vacuum marinator and pour in the marinade. Marinate for 20 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions, then let the steaks rest in the marinade for 10 minutes. Alternatively, place the steaks and the marinade in a large baking dish, turning the steaks to coat them with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 hours.",
        "Preheat an electric indoor grill on high heat according to the manufacturer's instructions. Remove the steaks from the marinade. Arrange the steaks on the grill and cook, turning once, 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until done to your liking.",
        "Transfer the steaks to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the steaks into slices and serve immediately. Serves 8."
