    "directions": [
        "Snip the pointed tips of artichoke leaves, and cut off the stems.  Wash and drain.  Holding artichoke firmly by base, firmly rap the top of it on a hard surface; this will open it so it can be stuffed.",
        "In a medium bowl combine bread cubes, garlic, parsley, Romano cheese, oregano,  2 tablespoons vegetable oil, salt and pepper; mix well.",
        "Press about 1/2 cup of stuffing into each artichoke.  Tightly pack stuffed artichokes together in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven.  Add enough water to reach half way up artichokes and add 3 tablespoons oil.",
        "Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour, or until leaves pull out easily."
