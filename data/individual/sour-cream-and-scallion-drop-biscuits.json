        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Drizzle in 6 Tbsp. butter and mix lightly with your hands just to distribute butter. Make a well in center of bowl and add scallions and sour cream. Mix with a wooden spoon until no dry spots remain and mixture forms a shaggy dough.",
        "Using 2 spoons, drop 1/2-cupfuls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing at least 1 1/2\" apart, or into a 12\" cast-iron skillet, arranging so sides of biscuits are just touching (you should have 8). Brush tops with remaining 2 Tbsp. butter; sprinkle with paprika. Bake biscuits until tops and bottoms are golden brown on top and bottom, 12\u201315 minutes."
