In another bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites until foamy and add a pinch salt and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in a stream, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks. Fold one third whites into yolk mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top.",
