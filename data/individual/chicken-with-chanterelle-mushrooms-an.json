        "Melt 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Cook the chicken breasts in the melted butter until browned, about 3 minutes per side; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Return the cooked mushrooms to the skillet and stir in chicken broth, reserved 1 tablespoon of flour-paprika mixture, Marsala wine, and dried tarragon. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until the sauce is thick, the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
