        "Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) in strips from 3 blood oranges. Place pork in large roasting pan. Rub with 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss onion, orange peel, and rosemary leaves with remaining 1 tablespoon oil in medium bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange onion mixture around pork. Roast until pork and onion are beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, squeeze enough juice from oranges to measure 3/4 cup; pour juice into small saucepan. Add wine, broth, and garlic. Boil until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 7 minutes.",
        "Add 1/2 cup orange juice mixture to roasting pan. Baste pork with pan juices. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F; continue roasting pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part of pork registers 150\u00b0F, basting often and adding more orange juice mixture as needed, about 30 minutes longer.",
