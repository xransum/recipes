Combine 3/4 cup ketchup, the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce in another small bowl. Pour over the brisket along with 3/4 cup water. Cover and cook on low, 8 hours.",
        "Remove the brisket to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, skim off the excess fat from the sauce; stir in the remaining 1/2 cup ketchup. Reserve one-third of the brisket (about 12 ounces) and 1 cup of the brisket sauce for Southwestern Brisket Hash. Slice the remaining brisket and divide among plates. Top with some of the sauce and serve with potato salad and cornbread.",
