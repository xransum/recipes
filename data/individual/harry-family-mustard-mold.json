        "In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, mustard powder and salt. Whisk in the vinegar until smooth, then whisk in the eggs.",
        "In the top of a double boiler, or in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Heat until gelatin dissolves, and stir to blend. Whisk the gelatin into the mustard mixture. Set aside to cool and thicken.",
        "When the gelatin is starting to set, whip the cream in a medium bowl until fluffy. Fold whipped cream into the mustard mixture until well blended. Pour into a greased 6 cup mold. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. If you don't have a mold, just pour it into a bowl. This recipe tastes great either way."
