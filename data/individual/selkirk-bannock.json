        "In a small saucepan heat milk to simmering and remove from heat. Mix in the butter and stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.",
        "In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Stir lukewarm milk into flour mixture until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
