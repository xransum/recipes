        "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over medium-high. Cook carrots, half of the onion, and 3 sliced garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add chicken carcass, if using, and broth; cover and simmer 30 minutes. (If you're not using carcass, simmer 15 minutes.)",
        "Meanwhile, toast farro in another large pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it starts to brown and smells nutty, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tsp. salt and 3 cups water. Cover and simmer until farro is tender and liquid evaporates, about 30 minutes; strain any remaining liquid, if necessary. Set aside 2 cups farro for Dill-Crusted Pork Tenderloin or reserve for another use.",

        "Wipe out pot, then heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil over low. Cook remaining onion and 9 sliced garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until tender and light golden, 8\u201310 minutes. Add remaining broth left in bowl, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add reserved chicken meat, beans, kale, lemon juice, pepper, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt and farro left in pot; cook until vegetables are cooked through, 3\u20135 minutes.",
