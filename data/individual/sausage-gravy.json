        "Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove sausage, drain and set aside.",
        "Pour off most of the fat from the pan, leaving about 2 to 3 tablespoons.  Return pan to medium-low heat and add flour.  Using a whisk, stir vigorously until roux forms, scraping bottom of pan. Reduce heat to low and let roux cook at least 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Grandma always \"burned\" hers a little on purpose.",
        "Add milk in a stream, whisking the whole time.  After adding about 2 1/2 cups, turn heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring constantly. Bring gravy to a boil and cook to desired thickness. Add more milk if a thinner gravy is desired. You may also add some of the cooked and crumbled sausage to the gravy."
