        "When the cycle is complete remove dough to a lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle.  Roll into a 14X9 inch rectangle. With a sharp knife, cut into eighteen 14X1/2 inch strips. Gently pull each strip into a rope 16 inches long. To shape into pretzels: Curve ends of each rope to make a circle; cross ends at top. Twist ends once and lay over bottom of circle. Place on greased baking sheets. DO NOT LET RISE.",
        "Combine lightly beaten egg and 1tablespoon water; brush on pretzels.  Sprinkle with kosher salt.  Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 18-20 minutes or until done. Remove from sheets and let pretzels cool on wire rack. Enjoy!"
