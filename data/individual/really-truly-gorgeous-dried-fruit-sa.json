        "Place the figs, apricots, prunes, cranberries, raisins, and golden raisins into a bowl. Pour in just enough water to cover. Cover the bowl and soak overnight, at least 8 hours.",
        "Pour the fruit with the soaking water into a saucepan. Stir in the pine nuts and honey. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is tender but still holds its shape, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat; return the fruit and liquid to the bowl, being careful not to break up the fruit. Cool to room temperature."
