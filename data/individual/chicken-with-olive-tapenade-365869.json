        "Heat grill. Fold four 18-inch-long pieces of foil in half; unfold and coat inside with cooking spray. Blend olives with 1 tablespoon reserved artichoke liquid in a food processor until paste forms. Place 1 cutlet in center of 1 half of each piece of foil; top each with 1/4 of olive paste. Toss all potatoes with 1/4 cup reserved artichoke liquid, rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon salt; divide potatoes evenly among packets, placing them to side of chicken. Combine artichokes, zucchini, onion and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; divide evenly among packets, placing them to other side of chicken. Combine wine and broth in a bowl. Fold foil to close and crimp 2 sides of each packet, leaving 1 side open; pour 2 tablespoons broth-wine mixture into each packet. Crimp third side of packets to seal; place on grill; close lid; cook until packets are fully puffed, 12 minutes. Carefully cut foil to open; serve."
