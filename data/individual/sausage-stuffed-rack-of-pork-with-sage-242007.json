Rub pork inside and out with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then rub outside with 1 teaspoon oil. Put sage, then sausages and scallions, inside flap and tie roast with string.",
        "Put roast, bone side down, in a large roasting pan with celery and olives, then pour in wine and remaining cup oil. Roast 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 325\u00b0F and roast, basting meat every 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat (do not touch bone) registers 155\u00b0F, about 2 hours more. Let stand 15 minutes. Serve with pan juices."
