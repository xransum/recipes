        "Place a wide, deep saucepan over medium-high heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle and then immediately evaporate. Add the oil, ginger and garlic and heat just until the garlic begins to sizzle, about 10 seconds.",
        "Add the greens all at once and, using tongs or 2 wooden spoons, toss and stir to coat with the oil and seasonings. Cover and allow the greens to steam with the droplets of rinsing water until tender, 9 to 12 minutes; the timing will depend on the varieties in the mix. Season with the salt.",
        "Transfer the greens to a warmed serving dish and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
