        "Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir the potatoes and carrots in the hot oil until hot, about 10 minutes. Season with salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. Pour the chicken broth over the mixture; continue cooking until the potatoes and carrots are soft, 10 to 15 minutes more.",
        "Pour about half of the potato-and-carrot mixture into a blender. Hold the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Return the pureed soup to the pot. Stir the Cheddar cheese into the soup until melted. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with parsley to serve."
