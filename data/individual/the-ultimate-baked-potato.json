        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lay 4 8-inch pieces of Reynolds Wrap\u00ae Aluminum Foil on a clean work surface. Center one potato on each foil sheet. Using a fork, prick the potato and drizzle it with olive oil and reserved fat. Sprinkle salt all around the potato. Wrap the foil tightly around the potato and place on a baking sheet. Repeat for each potato.",
        "Bake for 45 minutes and then check the potatoes for doneness. Carefully open the foil by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then open top of foil packet. Potato should be crispy and salty. If not, place back in the oven with the foil open, checking periodically, until it is crispy.",
        "Discard the foil and transfer potatoes to a serving plate. When cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to cut an X in the potato and push up from the bottom. Add butter, sour cream, crispy pancetta or bacon, cheddar cheese and sliced spring onions. Add fresh black pepper to taste and serve while hot, crispy and fresh."
