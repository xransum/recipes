        "Roast bell peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat (or on rack of a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat), turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap. Let stand, covered, 20 minutes. Peel, then halve lengthwise, discarding stems and seeds. Cut peppers into 1-inch pieces.",
        "While peppers stand, mince and mash half of garlic to a paste with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Combine with rosemary, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub onto chops.",
        "Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Saut\u00e9 pork, turning once, until pale golden in spots and just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.",
        "Add roasted peppers to skillet with onion, remaining garlic, cherry peppers, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add wine and broth and boil until liquid is reduced to a glaze, about 5 minutes. Add meat juices from plate and remove skillet from heat. Add butter, stirring until incorporated. Stir in lemon juice, parsley, and salt to taste and spoon over chops."
