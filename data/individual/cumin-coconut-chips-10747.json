    "directions": [
        "With an ice pick or a skewer test the 3 eyes of the coconut to find the weakest one and pierce it to make a hole. Drain the liquid into a bowl and reserve it for another use if desired. Bake the coconut in a preheat 400\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes, break it with a hammer on a work surface, and with the point of a strong small knife lever the flesh out of the shell carefully. With a vegetable peeler peel thin 1-inch-long slices of the coconut.",
        "In a bowl toss the coconut slices with the lime juice, the cumin, the cayenne, and salt to taste until they are coated well and bake them in a jelly-roll pan in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden."
