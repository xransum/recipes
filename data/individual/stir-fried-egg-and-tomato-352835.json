        "Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add scallions and stir-fry until just softened, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring and turning occasionally, until juices are released and tomatoes are slightly wilted but still intact, 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt over tomatoes and stir to combine. Return eggs to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are just cooked through. Serve sprinkled with reserved scallion greens."
