        "Place a stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Fry the salt pork for a few minutes to release some liquid. Add onion, and saute until translucent. Stir in the navy beans and turnip greens. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve with home made pepper vinegar and a side of cornbread for restaurant-style dining."
