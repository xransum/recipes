        "Transfer broccoli to a blender and allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.",
        "Place milk, Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in the blender. Carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree in a bowl."
