        "Beat the egg in a measuring cup.  Add the vinegar and enough cold water to make one cup of liquid.",
        "In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar.  Cut the lard up into small cubes, and add to the dry ingredients.  Blend with two knives, or a pastry blender, until the mixture is crumbly.  Add the liquid ingredients, mixing with a knife.  Do not use your hands as it tends to soften the lard too much.  Add additional water, if required, to make a soft ball of dough.  If the weather is warm, refrigerate your dough for 1/2 hour to chill it before rolling.  Warm dough doesn't roll as well, and requires too much flour, which makes it less flaky."
