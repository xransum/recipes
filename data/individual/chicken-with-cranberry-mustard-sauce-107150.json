Add chicken and saut\u00e9 until brown, about 5 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer chicken to plate. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to same skillet and melt. Whisk in flour and mustard; cook 1 minute. Gradually whisk in broth, juice concentrate, and cranberries. Bring to boil, whisking occasionally. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 6 minutes. Return chicken to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve."
