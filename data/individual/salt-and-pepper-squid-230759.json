        "Dredge one third of squid in one third of cornstarch, shaking off excess, then fry, stirring occasionally, until crisp and just barely beginning to turn pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Coat and fry remaining squid in 2 batches in same manner, returning oil to 390\u00b0F between batches. Toss squid with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
