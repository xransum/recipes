        "Into a large stock pot over medium heat, place chicken, mushrooms, and onions. Mix in tomatoes, carrots, and celery. Then stir in beans, garlic, rosemary, and enough water to not quite cover. Bring to a low simmer, and cook until chicken is soft, about 2 to 3 hours. Season with salt and pepper to taste. To thicken, stir in cornstarch, if necessary."
