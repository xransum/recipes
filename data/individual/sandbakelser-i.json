        "In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Mix in ground almonds and egg white. Stir in the flour.  Roll dough into 1 inch balls and press into the sandbakelse molds to form a thin coating. Place molds on a baking sheet and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before removing from molds. Gently tapping the molds on the counter will help to loosen the cookies."
