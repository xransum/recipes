        "Using electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at high speed until foamy.",
        "Gradually begin adding powdered sugar about a half cup at a time, waiting until sugar has been completely incorporated before adding the next scoop. Scrape down bowl often.",
        "Continue beating at high speed until a thick shiny icing appears. This can take as long as ten minutes. Reminiscent of Elmers glue, it should be thick but not stiff. When this is achieved, put slightly more than half of the icing into a bowl and cover with Saran Wrap and refrigerate. This will be your thinner icing used to coat the face of the cookies.",
        "If icing becomes thicker than desired, drizzle in lemon juice to thin it out.",
        "Continue mixing the remainder of the icing until it becomes slightly thicker. This will be your thicker icing used for outlines and surface piping.",
        "Divide icings into paper cups and color as needed."
