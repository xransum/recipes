        "In large pot over moderately high heat, combine 8 quarts of water to boil and salt. Bring to boil, then add linguine and cook to 1 minute short of al dente according to package directions (pasta should still be quite firm).",
        "Meanwhile, in large saut\u00e9 pan over moderately high heat, heat 6 tablespoons extra- olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and saut\u00e9 until just golden, about 30 seconds. Add clams and 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes and saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add wine, tomatoes and juice, and 1/2 cup parsley and simmer, uncovered, just until clams open, 7 to 8 minutes.",
        "Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain linguine and add to pan. Simmer, tossing occasionally, until linguine is just tender, about 1 minute. If necessary, add some of reserved cooking water to keep moist. Remove from heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and extra-virgin olive oil, tossing to coat. Transfer to serving dish and serve immediately."
