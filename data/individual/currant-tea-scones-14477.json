        "Pour boiling water into a small cup and steep tea bag 2 minutes. Remove and reserve tea bag and stir in currants. Into a bowl sift together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes and add to flour mixture, blending with fingertips until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with remainder in small (roughly pea-size) lumps. Squeeze liquid from tea bag into cup and discard bag. With a fork stir 6 tablespoons half-and-half into flour mixture until just combined and a sticky dough is formed. Stir in currant mixture.",
        "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a 5-inch round. Transfer round to baking sheet and with a pastry brush lightly coat with additional half-and-half. Sprinkle dough with remaining 1/2 teaspoon sugar and with a knife score 1/4-inch deep into quarters.",
        "Bake scones in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to a rack to cool. Break scones along score marks and serve warm or at room temperature."
