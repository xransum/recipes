        "Brown the pork",
        "Season the pork shoulder on all sides with salt and pepper. In a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the pork and brown well on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer the pork to a slow cooker.",
        "Pour off the excess fat from the fry pan and set the pan over high heat. Pour in the broth, wine and orange juice and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Stir in the brown sugar, bring the liquid to a boil and pour the contents of the pan over the pork.",
        "Cook the pork",
        "Add the rosemary sprig to the slow cooker. Scatter the plums and apricots around the sides of the meat. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
        "Carve the pork",
        "Remove the rosemary sprig and discard. Transfer the pork to a platter and spoon the fruit compote around the meat. Slice the pork across the grain or, if the meat is too tender to slice neatly, use a pair of forks to tear it into large chunks. Serve with the compote alongside. Serves 8.",
