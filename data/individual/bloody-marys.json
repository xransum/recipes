Add a few sprinkles of steak seasoning, 2 or 3 dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of cayenne pepper to each. Divide the tomato juice between the jars and add a dash each of salt and pepper to each jar.",

(If you prefer an iceless Bloody Mary, screw on the lid of each mason jar and shake for 20 to 30 seconds, then use the lid of the jar as a strainer and pour into glasses.)",
