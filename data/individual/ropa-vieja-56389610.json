        "2. Nestle the skirt steak(s) into the sauce, cutting large steaks to fit the size of your slow cooker and overlapping them as necessary without folding the steaks over onto themselves. In the end, they should all be submerged in the sauce.",
        "3. Cover and cook on low for 9 hours, or until the beef in so tender it can be shredded with a fork. Remove the bay leaf and use two forks to shred the meat completely. Stir in the vinegar before serving."
