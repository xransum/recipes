        "1. To make the popper filling, combine the cheeses in a medium-size bowl and stir them together with a fork. Put the cheese mixture in a gallon-size zipper-top plastic bag and cut a small hole in one corner of the bag. Squeeze each jalape\u00f1o full of the cheese mixture. Place the cheese-filled jalape\u00f1os in the egg carton. Push a pecan half into each pepper. Wrap a half strip of bacon around each jalape\u00f1o and secure with a toothpick.",
        "2. Fill your charcoal chimney with briquets, set the chimney on the bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in your smoker. For a gas grill, turn half the burners to high.",
        "3. When the coals are ready, dump them into the bottom of your grill, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the drained wood chips on the hot coals, or put the dry wood chips in a metal container and place closest to a burner on a gas grill. Place the jalape\u00f1os on the indirect side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.",
        "4. Smoke the peppers at 350\u00b0F for 1 hour and 15 minutes until the bacon is cooked and the jalape\u00f1o have a smoky aroma."
