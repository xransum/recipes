        "Using a rolling pin or your hands, gently roll out or stretch the pizza dough into a 10-inch round. Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour and lay the dough on top. Lightly brush the dough with the garlic-infused olive oil. Scatter the cheese evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Arrange the corn, bell pepper and chorizo on top, overlapping the ingredients slightly.",
        "Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated Pizza Que Grill, cover the grill and bake until the crust is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Scatter the cilantro on top. Using the pizza peel, transfer the pizza to a cutting board and cut into slices. Serve immediately. Serves 2 to 4."
