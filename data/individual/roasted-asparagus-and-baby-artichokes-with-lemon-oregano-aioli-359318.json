        "Bring large saucepan of salted water to boil. Fill large bowl with cold water; squeeze juice from lemon halves into water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, pull off all dark green outer leaves until only tender inner yellow leaves remain. Cut off top 1 inch from artichoke. Cut off stem and trim around stem base of artichoke. Cut artichoke lengthwise in half and immediately drop into lemon water to prevent discoloration. Repeat with remaining artichokes.",
