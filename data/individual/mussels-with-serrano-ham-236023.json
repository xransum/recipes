        "Cook mussels in a dry 3- to 4-quart deep heavy pot, tightly covered, over moderately high heat until mussels just open wide, checking frequently after 3 minutes and stirring once, then re-covering tightly. Transfer opened mussels to a shallow baking pan using a slotted spoon. (Discard any mussels that remain unopened after 8 minutes and reserve any mussel liquid remaining in pot.) When cool enough to handle, detach mussels from shells and reserve (with any juice). Separate mussel shells, reserving half of shells and discarding remainder.",
        "Whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, then add ham, almonds, piquillo peppers, parsley, and mussels (without shells) with 3 to 4 tablespoons of reserved juice and toss until mussels are coated. Spoon 1 mussel with some of dressing into each reserved shell and serve immediately."
