        "Soften the beans in simmering water for about 2 minutes. In another pan, heat the oil, red peppers, rosemary, and garlic over medium-low heat until the rosemary starts to sizzle. Turn off heat. Drain the beans well, add them to the pan, and let soak in the oil for 30 minutes. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stalk; discard the stalk and 1 of the red peppers. In a blender or food processor, puree the beans, oil, garlic, rosemary leaves, lemon juice, and the remaining red pepper. Add the salt and black pepper. Drizzle with more extra-virgin olive oil and serve with crostini.",
