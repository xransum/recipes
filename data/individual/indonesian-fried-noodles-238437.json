Carefully pour shallot mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a heatproof bowl. Transfer shallots to paper towels to drain, reserving shallot oil. (Shallots will crisp as they cool.) Wipe wok clean with paper towels.",
        "Cook noodles in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling unsalted water , stirring to separate, until just tender, 15 seconds to 1 minute.

Heat 1 tablespoon reserved shallot oil in wok over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then add eggs, swirling in wok, and cook until barely set in center, about 2 minutes. Gently slide egg cr\u00eape out onto a cutting board, then roll into a loose cylinder and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch strips (do not unroll). Keep warm, loosely covered with foil.",
        "Heat 3 tablespoons reserved shallot oil in wok over high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry onions with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt until deep golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and chile and stir-fry 1 minute, then add tofu and stir-fry 3 minutes. Add snow peas and long beans and stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add sauce and bring to a boil, then add noodles and stir-fry (use 2 spatulas to stir if necessary) until noodles are hot. Transfer to a large platter and arrange egg over noodles.
