    "directions": [
        "Place the vinegar and the wine in a crock or jar, such as a large canning jar. It should hold at least 1 gallon, with enough extra space to allow for plenty of air circulation. Cover the opening with a cotton towel or piece of muslin, secure it with a rubber band, and place it in a warm spot (68-70\u00b0F.) for 1 to 2 months. Check it occasionally, and sniff it. It will gradually assume a distinct vinegar aroma, and you will notice a slight film, or voile, appearing on the top. Don't move the jar, for it might disrupt the film, which is the beginning of the bacteria that will create a blanket on top of the vinegar and turn any wine you add to vinegar.",
        "When the mixture has a distinct smell of vinegar (after at least 1 month), transfer it to a crock with a spigot, or to a small barrel with spigot and a bunghole, by pouring as much of the vinegar as possible into the new container, then carefully transferring the m\u00e8re by hand. Draw off one third of the vinegar and bottle it for use. Replace that with an equal amount of wine. From then on, add ends of bottles to the vinegar crock, making sure you never submerge the m\u00e8re and that you don't add too much all at once, which could cause the m\u00e8re to expire.",
        "After adding wine, wait at least 2 weeks to draw off any vinegar."
