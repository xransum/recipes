        "Marinate the beef",
        "In a large, nonreactive bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, oil, green onions, pear, garlic, ginger, sugar, sesame seeds and red pepper flakes until the sugar dissolves. Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes, add to the bowl and mix well. Cover and let stand while the grill heats. (The beef can be refrigerated at this point for up to 8 hours; turn occasionally in the marinade.)",
        "Prepare the grill",
        "Prepare a hot fire in a grill. Soak 4 bamboo skewers in water to cover while the grill heats, then drain just before using.",
        "Grill the beef skewers",
        "Lightly oil the grill rack. Remove the beef from the marinade and dip the mushrooms into the marinade. Thread beef cubes and mushrooms onto each skewer. Place the skewers on the grill and cook, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to individual plates or a platter and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
