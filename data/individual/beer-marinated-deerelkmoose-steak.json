        "Whisk together beer, soy sauce, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, and hot sauce in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add venison steaks, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove steaks from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.",
        "Cook steaks on the preheated grill until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Allow steaks to rest for 5 minutes before serving."
