        "Heat oil over medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet. Fry ham on both sides until browned. Remove ham and set aside. Stir coffee and salt into the hot oil. Return to a boil over medium heat, stirring to get any bits of ham that may be stuck to the pan. Cook until the mixture has reduced by 1/3. Remove from heat and serve over ham and biscuits."
