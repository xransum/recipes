        "Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round. Lightly dust a bakers peel with cornmeal and lay the dough on top. Lightly brush the dough with the olive oil and spread the tomatoes evenly on top, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Lay the cheese slices evenly over the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter the bell peppers and sausage evenly over the cheese. Sprinkle with half of the oregano and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza pan. Bake until the bottom of the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the pizza with the remaining oregano. Let cool for 5 minutes, then cut into slices and serve. Serves 2."
