        "Combine lentils with 3 cups of water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Once the lentils have simmered for 10 minutes, stir in the cooked onion along with the rice, TVP, chicken bouillon, curry powder, cumin, parsley flakes, and 2 1/2 cups of water. Return to a boil over high heat, then remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid during this time. After 20 minutes, remove the lid and stir before serving."
