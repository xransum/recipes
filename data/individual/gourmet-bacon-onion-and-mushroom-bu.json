        "Saute onion and mushrooms over medium-high heat in the same skillet until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add wine and reduce heat to medium, stirring frequently, until wine reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Remove onion mixture from heat.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place hamburger buns on grill until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Shape ground beef into 8 patties. Sprinkle salt, garlic powder, and ground black pepper over patties.",
        "Cook patties on the preheated grill until browned on one side, about 6 minutes. Flip patties, top each with one slice of cheese and continue grilling until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).",
        "Transfer burgers to toasted buns. Place some of the onion mixture on top using a slotted spoon. Add chunks of bacon."
