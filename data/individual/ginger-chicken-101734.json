        "Take a piece of fresh ginger about the size of a finger and chop it fine or grate it on a coarse grater. Combine it with 1 finely chopped clove of garlic and a sprig or two of fresh coriander or Chinese parsley (also known as cilantro). Put this mixture in the cavity of a chicken and add a dash or two of soy sauce. Close the vent with foil, truss the bird and brush it with a mixture of soy sauce, peanut oil and ground ginger. Spit it and roast, basting during the cooking with more soy, oil and ginger.",
        "Serve this chicken with a good chutney, hot mustard and additional soy sauce. Rice, of course, is the perfect accompaniment. Dress the rice with plenty of butter, chopped toasted almonds, salt and freshly ground black pepper. To drink with this there is nothing better than iced or hot tea. Finish the dinner with vanilla ice cream topped with chopped preserved ginger. This is an amazing combination of flavors and sensations: tangy, hot, sweet, and mellow."
