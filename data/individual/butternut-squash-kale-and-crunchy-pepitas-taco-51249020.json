        "To make the crema, soak the raw cashews in room-temperature water to cover for at least 1 hour. Drain and reserve.",
        "Toast the cumin in a small, dry, heavy skillet over medium heat for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Transfer to a spice grinder, let cool, and grind finely.",
        "In a blender, combine the cashews, cumin, lime juice, water, and salt. Start the blender on the lowest speed and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend for at least 1 minute, until a creamy consistency. Pour into a serving bowl and set aside.",
        "To make the pumpkin seeds, heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the pumpkin seeds and saut\u00e9 for about 2 minutes, taking care that they do not burn. The seeds will begin to puff up and pop. Once they appear toasted, immediately pour them into a bowl. Toss with the cayenne and salt and set aside.",
        "To make the filling, heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 for about 3 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute more. Add the squash and saut\u00e9 for 6 to 7 minutes, just until the squash begins to soften. Season with the chile powder and salt.",
        "Add the kale and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until it begins to wilt. Remove from the heat, taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed.",
        "Serve with the tortillas, crema, pumpkin seeds, onion, cilantro, and salsa. To assemble each taco, invite guests to spoon about 1/2 cup of the warm filling into a tortilla and top with some crema and pumpkin seeds. If guests want more toppings, they can finish off their tacos with onion, cilantro, and salsa."
