        "Cut a 12x24 inch sheet of aluminum foil and place it on a flat surface. Mix the coconut and crushed graham crackers together on the foil until well blended. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out 6 baseball-sized amounts of ice cream. Use your hands to form into balls, and roll in the coconut mixture. Wrap each ice cream ball in aluminum foil, and freeze at least 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, beat the whipping cream until soft peaks form. To serve, place 1/2 cup strawberries on 6 plates. Remove foil from the ice cream balls and place one on each plate. Top with caramel sauce and whipped cream."
