        "In a large bowl toss together well the cheese and the cornstarch. Rub the inside of a heavy saucepan with the garlic, leaving it in the pan, add the wine, 3/4 cup water, and the lemon juice, and boil the mixture for 1 minute. Stir in the cheese mixture gradually and bring the mixture to a simmer over moderate heat, stirring. Stir in the Calvados and simmer the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes. Transfer the fondue to a fondue pot, swirl in the chutney, and set the fondue pot on its stand over a low flame. Serve the breadsticks, the potatoes, the vegetables, and the tortellini for dipping into the fondue. Stir the fondue often to keep it combined."
