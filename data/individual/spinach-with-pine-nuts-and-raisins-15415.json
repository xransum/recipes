        "Rinse the spinach well and remove the stems. Place in a large saut\u00e9 pan with only the rinsing water clinging to the leaves. Cook over medium heat, turning as needed until wilted, just a few minutes. Drain well and set aside. Add the olive oil to the now-empty pan and place over medium heat. Add the onions and saut\u00e9 until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the spinach, raisins, and pine nuts and saut\u00e9 briefly to warm through. Season with salt and pepper and serve warm or at room temperature."
