        "In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the fettuccine until it is al dente. While the fettuccine is cooking, in a small saucepan heat the oil and the garlic over moderately low heat just until the mixture is hot and remove the pan from the heat. Drain the fettuccine well and in a bowl toss it with the oil mixture, the minced parsley, the mint, the tomatoes, the goat cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Divide the pasta between 2 plates and garnish it with the parsley sprigs."
