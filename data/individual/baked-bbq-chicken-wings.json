        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and lightly brush with 1 teaspoon oil.",
        "Place wings in a single layer on the prepared pan, skin-side up, with a little space between each wing. Brush the top of each wing with the 1/3 cup oil. Brush hot sauce over the oil layer.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven, basting with pan juices a few times, until wings are browned, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
        "Remove pan from oven and soak up excess grease with paper towels. Spread barbeque sauce over top side of wings.",
        "Return wings to oven and bake for 5 minutes. Spread a second layer of barbeque sauce over wings; bake for 5 minutes more."
