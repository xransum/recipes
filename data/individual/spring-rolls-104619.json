        "1. Combine the pork with 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch and the soy sauce. Set aside.",
        "2. Combine the baby shrimp with the wine. Set aside.",
        "3. Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or skillet and cook the pork mixture, stirring until the pork loses its raw color.",
        "4. Add the bamboo shoots and shredded carrots and salt to taste. Add 1/4 cup of the chicken broth, stirring and cooking quickly.",
        "5. Blend 2 remaining teaspoons of cornstarch with the leftover 1/4 cup of chicken broth and stir into the cooked filling. Add the baby shrimp, bean sprouts, and Chinese celery cabbage and cook, stirring briefly, for approximately 1 minute. Immediately remove the filling from the heat. Turn into a colander to let the filling cool and drain.",
