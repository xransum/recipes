        "In a bowl with an electric mixer beat together the whole egg, the yolk, the vanilla, and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar until the mixture is thick and pale. In a bowl beat the cream with cleaned beaters, adding the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar, until the mixture holds soft peaks. Fold the egg mixture into the whipped cream mixture. Into another bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt and fold the flour mixture into the cream mixture.",
        "Divide the batter among 6 buttered and floured 1/2-cup muffin tins and bake the cakes in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden. (The batter will flow over the rims slightly.) Let the cakes cool in the tins on a rack for 10 minutes and turn them out onto the rack, leaving them upside down. Dust the cakes with the confectioners' sugar and serve them with the peaches and the raspberries."
