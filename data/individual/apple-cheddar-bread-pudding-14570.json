        "Spread bread slices thinly on 1 side with 1/2 stick butter. In a small bowl stir together 1/4 cup granulated sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and sprinkle evenly over buttered sides of bread. Arrange bread, buttered sides up, on baking sheets and toast in batches in middle of oven until just golden, about 15 minutes. Cool cinnamon toast on racks and quarter each slice into triangles, reserving 24 triangles.",

In a large heavy skillet melt remaining 1/2 stick butter with brown sugar over moderately high heat, stirring, and add apples and water. Cook mixture, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Remove lid and cook apples until just tender and most liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes more.",

Spoon half of apple mixture evenly over toasts and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 cup Cheddar. Top with another layer of cinnamon toasts and remaining apple mixture. Arrange reserved cinnamon toast, sugared sides up, overlapping slightly, in a ring around edge of dish.",
