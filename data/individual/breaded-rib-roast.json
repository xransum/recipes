        "Place roast on a roasting rack inside of a shallow baking pan. Roast in a preheated oven until desired doneness; about 2 hours. Rare beef is 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C). Well done beef is 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) Always use a clean meat thermometer to check for doneness."
