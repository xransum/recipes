        "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and cook chicken rolls for 15 minutes, turning to brown on each side. When browned, cook for an additional 15 minutes, until cooked through and chicken juices run clear.",
        "To Make Raspberry Sauce: Meanwhile, place raspberries, sugar and water in a blender. Blend for 3 to 4 minutes, then pour through a sieve to remove seeds.",
        "Remove cooked chicken rolls from skillet to paper towels to drain. When drained, transfer to a serving plate and drizzle with raspberry sauce. Drizzle some sauce onto the plate in a circle, and serve."
