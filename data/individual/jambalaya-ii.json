        "Place chicken and sausage in a large pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is opaque and falls from the bone, 45 minutes.  (I usually do this the night before and refrigerate to skim the fat.)  Remove chicken and sausage, reserving broth.  Shred chicken.",
