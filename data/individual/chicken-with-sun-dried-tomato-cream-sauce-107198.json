        "Add garlic, tomatoes, and red pepper flakes to skillet and saut\u00e9, stirring, until garlic is pale golden, about 1 minute. Add wine and boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, covered.",

        "Transfer sauce to a deep heatproof bowl or 1-quart glass measure and pur\u00e9e with an immersion blender until almost smooth. (Alternatively, blend sauce in a standing blender.
