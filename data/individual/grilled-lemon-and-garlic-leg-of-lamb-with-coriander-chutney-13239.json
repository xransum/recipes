        "Prepare grill.",
        "Remove lamb from bags, discarding marinade, and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 8 to 12 minutes on each side (medium-rare for thin parts of meat and rare for thicker parts). (Alternatively, lamb may be broiled 3 to 4 inches from heat.) Cool lamb to room temperature. Lamb may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped well. Slice lamb thin and arrange on a platter. Bring lamb to cool room temperature, its surface covered with plastic wrap.",
