        "For the first pressure cook, add the smoked paprika, chili powder and black-eyed peas and stir. Add the dates and water but do not stir. Put the lid on the Instant Pot and cook at high pressure for 3 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.",

        "To serve, you can add as much hot sauce as you want to the pot or pass it at the table so diners can add it themselves."
