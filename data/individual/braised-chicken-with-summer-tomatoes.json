        "Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker over medium-high heat, warm the 2 Tbs. olive oil. Add the chicken, skin side down, and brown, turning once, 7 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Add the onion to the insert, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until just golden, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute. Add the 1/2 cup olive oil and the broth, and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Place the chicken, skin side up, in the insert and tuck the tarragon sprigs in between. Place the tomatoes on top and bring the mixture to a simmer. Place the insert in the slow-cooker base, cover and cook on low until the meat nearly falls off the bone, about 3 hours.",
        "Using a spoon, transfer the chicken, tomatoes, some of onion-garlic mixture and braising juices to a platter. Garnish with the chopped tarragon and serve immediately with white cheddar grits. Serves 6."
