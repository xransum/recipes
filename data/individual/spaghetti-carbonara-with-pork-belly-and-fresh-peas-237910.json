        "Discard any solidified fat on surface of pork belly mixture. Remove pork from cooking liquid, scraping any gelatinous mixture back into saucepan. Rewarm mixture in saucepan just until melted. Strain liquid into measuring cup. Add white wine if necessary to measure 1/2 cup. Cut rind and all but 1/4-inch layer of fat from pork belly. Slice pork crosswise into 1/2-inch slices, then cut slices crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick strips.",
        "Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork belly and cook until browned on all sides, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add pork cooking liquid and 1/4 cup wine. Bring to boil, then cover and keep warm.",

Add mixture to skillet with pork and toss, adding more cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if dry. Season generously with black pepper. Divide among bowls and serve, passing remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese alongside."
