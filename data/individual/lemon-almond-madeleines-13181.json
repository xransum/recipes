        "In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the eggs with the granulated sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and forms a ribbon when the beaters are lifted and beat in the almond extract and the zest. Sift the flour in 4 batches over the mixture, folding it in gently after each addition, add the almonds and the butter, and fold them in gently but thoroughly. Spoon the batter into twenty-four 3- by 2-inch buttered madeleine molds and bake the madeleines in the lower third of a preheated 375\u00b0F oven for 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Turn the madeleine out on racks, let them cool, and sift the confectioners' sugar over them."
