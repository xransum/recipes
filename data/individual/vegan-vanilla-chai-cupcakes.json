        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. Line a cupcake pan with cupcake liners and set aside. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the almond milk and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the Earth Balance and sugar and beat with an electric mixer until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add in the yogurt and vanilla extract and mix on low until combined. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and the almond milk mixture to the creamed butter, mixing on low speed until everything is mixed together.",
        "Pour the batter into the cupcake liners until each liner is about two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack."
