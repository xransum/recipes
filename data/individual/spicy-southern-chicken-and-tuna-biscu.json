        "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
        "Place biscuit dough on a baking sheet, about 1 to 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 11 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow the biscuits to cool.",
        "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and dice into 1/2 inch cubes.",
        "Mix tuna, mayonnaise, and mustard in a bowl until combined. Stir in white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and cumin. Reserve 1/4 of the tuna mixture in a separate bowl. Combine the remaining 3/4 portion of the tuna mixture with the chicken. Split each biscuit in half and place over a bed of lettuce leaves. Divide chicken and tuna mixture on top of each biscuit half. Use the remaining 1/4 portion of the tuna mixture as a garnish on the lettuce leaves."
