        "Grate the gingerroot into a fine sieve set over a bowl, press on the pulp to extract 2 teaspoons of the juice, and discard the pulp. To the bowl add the vinegar, the oil, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Divide the watercress among 4 salad plates and arrange some of the daikon rounds down the center of each plate. Roll the salmon into 8 rosettes, arrange 2 rosettes on each plate, and drizzle the dressing over the salads."
