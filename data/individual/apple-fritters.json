        "Heat a couple of inches of vegetable oil in a heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium to medium-low heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 340 degrees F.",
        "In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a fork, then add the milk, melted butter and vanilla. Gently fold the dry and wet ingredients together until just combined (do not over-mix). Fold in the apples, adding enough to make a very chunky batter.",
        "Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the hot oil, 6 to 8 at a time. Fry until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Dust generously with powdered sugar and serve warm with sausage and bacon!"
