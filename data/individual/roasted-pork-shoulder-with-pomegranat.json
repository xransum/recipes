        "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season the pork roast with garlic, kosher salt and pepper. Place in a roasting pan.",
        "Bake the roast for 1hour in the preheated oven. While the roast is baking, combine the pomegranate seeds and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, until the pomegranate seeds have broken down and released their juices. Press through a strainer to get as much juice as possible. You should have about 3/4 cup of juice.",
        "Pour the juice from the pomegranate into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium heat until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and mix in the balsamic vinegar, sugar and cinnamon.",
        "After the roast has been in the oven for 1 hour, start to baste it with the pomegranate sauce, using a brush to apply to the top and sides. Continue to roast the pork until the internal temperature has reached 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving and serving."
