        "Add tomato paste, garlic, onions, oregano, and bell pepper juice to the browned beef.  Allow it to settle a little bit, folding it all together.  Add the tomatoes and cover; simmer for another 15 minutes.   With a fork or spatula crush the tomatoes and blend the juice into the sauce; continue simmering for about 10 more minutes.  Serve over cooked pasta."
