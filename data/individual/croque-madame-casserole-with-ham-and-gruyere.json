        "Arrange racks in top and middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. If bread is not a day old or still feels moist, arrange slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake, flipping once, until dry to the touch but not toasted, 5\u201310 minutes. Using a 2\" ring or cookie cutter or sharp paring knife, cut a hole in the center of 6 bread slices. Trim bread to fit in 2 even layers in a 13x9\" baking dish, with the whole slices on the bottom and the slices with holes on the top, forming 6 sandwiches. Remove from dish.",
        "Melt butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until butter foams then subsides (make sure it doesn't brown), and mixture is light gold and thickened, about 3 minutes. Slowly add milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, whisking, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 4\u20136 minutes. Reduce heat to very low. Whisk in nutmeg, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper into the B\u00e9chamel sauce. Whisk in 1 cup Gruy\u00e8re a handful at a time, making sure cheese is melted before adding more. (B\u00e9chamel with cheese added is technically called a Mornay sauce.) You should have about 3 1/2 cups of sauce.",
        "Spread one-third of the B\u00e9chamel in the dish. Arrange 6 whole slices of bread in a single layer in dish. Spread Dijon evenly on bread. Top each with 2 slices of ham, folding to fit on bread if necessary.",
        "Spread another third of the B\u00e9chamel over ham. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup Gruy\u00e8re. Place 6 bread slices with holes on top to form 6 sandwiches. Spread remaining B\u00e9chamel over sandwiches; sprinkle with 1 cup Gruy\u00e8re (avoid holes to save room for eggs).",
        "Crack 1 egg into each hole. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Gruy\u00e8re. Season with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.",
        "Spray a large piece of foil with nonstick spray. Place foil, oiled side down, over baking dish, crimping to seal. Bake on middle rack for 20 minutes. Remove foil, increase oven temperature to 400\u00b0F, transfer dish to top rack, and bake until egg whites are just barely set and yolks are still runny (eggs will continue to cook slightly when removed from oven), 8\u201312 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving."
