        "Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook veal, turning over once, until golden and just cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes total. Transfer veal to a plate.",
        "Finely chop remaining garlic clove and add to skillet, then cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 30 seconds. Add radicchio and beans and cook, stirring, until radicchio begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar and cook until most of vinegar is evaporated. Whisk together broth and cornstarch, then add to bean mixture and boil, scraping up brown bits, until sauce is thickened slightly and about two thirds of liquid is evaporated, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Serve veal with radicchio and beans."
