        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook steaks 2 minutes or so on each side to create a nice crust. Transfer skillet to oven; cook steaks until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Slice 1/2-inch thick."
