        "Combine 1 bottle (750 milliliters) medium-bodied aged rum (such as El Dorado 5 Year, Mount Gay Eclipse Black, or Appleton Estate V/X), 3 allspice berries, 3 cloves, 1 cardamom pod, 1 segment of a star anise pod, 1/2 cinnamon stick, and 1/8 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg in a lidded 1-quart jar. Twist a 4x1\" strip of orange peel (no white pith) just above the mixture to release some of its oils; add peel to jar. Split 1/2 vanilla bean lengthwise; scrape seeds into jar and add bean. Cover jar tightly; shake to combine. Let sit in a dark place for 2 days, shaking once after first day. Strain mixture through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bottle; discard spices. Will keep indefinitely if sealed tightly and stored in a dark, dry place."
