Cook until apples begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove apples from the skillet and allow to cool. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel.",
        "Place 1/2 cup of butter in skillet over medium heat. Constantly swirl the butter in the pan, watching carefully so butter does not burn. The butter is \"browned\" when it is a tan color and smells nutty. This can take 3 to 10 minutes. When butter is ready, promptly pour it into a bowl to prevent it from burning.",

        "Unroll the pie crust on a silicone mat. Using a small cookie cutter, press out the pie crust \"chips.\" Lift the pie crust up, leaving the \"chips\" on the mat. Place the mat on a baking sheet. The remaining dough may be rolled out to 1/4\" thick and the process repeated to use up all the dough and make more \"chips\" using separate silicone mats (or parchment).",
