        "Place the skewers directly over the fire and grill for about 4 or 5 minutes until the marshmallows have browned.",
        "At the same time, grill one side of the bread. Turn the slices over and move to the indirect side of the grill. Place a piece of chocolate on each slice and sprinkle with a pinch of coarse salt. Remove from the grill when the chocolate is soft but still holds its shape.",
        "Serve the skewers with the grilled bread for a grown-up version of s'mores."
