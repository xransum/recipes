        "Tear the arugula leaves into a bowl, sprinkle with salt and add the 2 tsp. olive oil. Toss to mix well. Add a grinding of pepper if the arugula is mild; often its own peppery taste is sufficient.",
        "Choose a white or light-colored serving plate or individual plates that highlight the colors of the ingredients. Arrange the slices of bresaola around the edge of the platter or plates. Place the arugula in the middle. Using a handheld cheese slicer or a vegetable peeler, shave the cheese over the arugula.",
        "Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Place the olive oil bottle on the table for diners to add to the bresaola. Pass the lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. Serves 4.",
