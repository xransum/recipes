        "Pour 2 cups of water into a sealable 1 quart container, and stir in the yogurt until dissolved. Whisk in powdered milk until completely blended. Fill with remaining water, and stir. Close the lid, and set in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I use a gas oven (turned off), or even a heating pad. Refrigerate, until chilled before serving."
