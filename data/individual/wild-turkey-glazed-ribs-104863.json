    "directions": [
        "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line with aluminum foil a shallow roasting pan large enough to hold the ribs in one layer.",
        "2. Combine the bourbon, garlic, honey, mustard, Tabasco, salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Stir well to mix.",
        "3. Brush the rack of ribs on both sides with the glaze, then arrange, meaty-side up, in the prepared pan, making sure they don't overlap. Roast the ribs for 20 to 30 minutes to render as much of the fat as possible; pour or spoon off the fat and discard. Reduce the oven temperature to 275\u00b0F. and cook the ribs, brushing with reserved marinade every 30 minutes and turning several times, until they're tender and the glaze has caramelized and become crispy and blackened in places, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Let the ribs cook for 10 minutes after the last brush with the marinade.",
        "4. To serve, cut the racks into individual ribs and pile them on a platter."
