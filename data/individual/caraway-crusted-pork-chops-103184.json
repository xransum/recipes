        "Finely grind caraway seeds and peppercorns in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle and spread on a plate. Season chops with salt and dredge in spice mixture, coating completely.",
        "Heat oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 chops until golden brown and just cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer chops to a plate. Add vinegar to skillet and deglaze over moderately high heat, scraping up brown bits, until most of vinegar is evaporated, about 20 seconds. Add juice and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir butter into sauce with salt to taste and pour over pork chops."
