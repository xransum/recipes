        "Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the lamb, and cook until browned and no longer pink, breaking up into crumbles, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and their juice, celery, orzo, salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the orzo is tender and has absorbed the liquid from the tomatoes, about 12 minutes."
