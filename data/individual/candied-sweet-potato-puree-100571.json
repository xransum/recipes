        "Finely grate enough zest from orange to measure 1 teaspoon and squeeze enough juice from orange to measure 1/2 cup. In a small saucepan melt 4 tablespoons butter over moderate heat and stir in zest, orange juice, sugar, bourbon, nutmeg, and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved.",
        "When potatoes are just cool enough to handle, peel and put flesh in a food processor. Add butter mixture and pur\u2029e just until smooth. Sweet-potato pur\u00e9e may be made up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled in a 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish, covered. Reheat pur\u00e9e, covered, in middle of 350\u00b0F. oven. Transfer pur\u00e9e to a serving dish and dot with remaining 2 tablespoons butter, letting it melt to form pools."
