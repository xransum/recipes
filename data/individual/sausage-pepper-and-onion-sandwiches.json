        "Cut the sausages apart into individual links if necessary, place the sausage links into a large skillet over medium heat, and brown them on all sides. Set the sausages aside, reserving the pan drippings.",
        "Pour the whole tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, and tomato sauce into a large saucepan with a lid; stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, sugar, and onion powder. Bring the mixture to a boil; add the cooked sausages, pan drippings, green peppers, and onions. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 6 hours. Serve on Italian hoagie buns."
