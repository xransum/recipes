Transfer onions to large bowl. Repeat with remaining 1/4 cup oil and remaining onions. Return all onions to same skillet. Add vinegar and sugar, then cranberries, and simmer over medium heat until cranberries pop and juices thicken slightly, about 8 minutes. Stir in chipotle chiles. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)",
