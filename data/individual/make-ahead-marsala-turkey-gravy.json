        "Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place turkey necks in the Dutch oven and cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion, celery, and carrot; cook and stir until onion is soft and slightly brown, about 5 minutes.",
        "Pour Marsala wine over turkey necks; increase heat to high and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Simmer until wine is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes.",
        "Stir in water, 1/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, garlic, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil then decrease heat to low; simmer, skimming any foam or fat that rises to the top. Cover the Dutch oven almost completely; simmer until meat is falling off the bones, 4 to 5 hours. Strain turkey stock carefully into a clean container and cool completely, about 2 hours.",
        "Place 1/4 ounce dry porcini mushrooms in a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until mushrooms are soft enough to dice, about 15 minutes. Drain, squeezing out excess water, and dice. Set aside.",
        "Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Add diced porcini mushrooms; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir flour into mushrooms and butter; cook and stir until flour is no longer gritty, about 3 minutes.",
        "Whisk in turkey stock, increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is 1/3 reduced and thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in cream, season with salt and pepper to taste."
