        "Bring a saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil over high heat. Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch for 1 minute. Using a strainer, scoop out the peas and refresh them in the ice water. Scoop them out of the ice water with the strainer and set aside.",
        "Add the asparagus to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Add more ice to the bowl of ice water, if needed. Drain the asparagus and refresh in the ice water. Drain again, slice the asparagus in half lengthwise and set aside.",
        "In a bowl, combine the peas, asparagus, pea shoots, lemon zest, lemon juice and olive oil and toss to combine. Add the sugar if not using Meyer lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter or divide among individual plates and serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.",
