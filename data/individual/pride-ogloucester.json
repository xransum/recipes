Sprinkle fillets with paprika, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the fish fillets to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cook and stir the onions and green bell peppers in the hot skillet until the onions are tender and translucent, about 10 minutes; spoon away any excess oil, and stir in the tomatoes. Bring the vegetables to a boil, and spread them over the fish. Cover the dish with foil.",
