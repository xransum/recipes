        "Heat the vegetable oil in a large, shallow skillet over medium heat; fry the chana dal and urad dal in the hot oil until they begin to smell toasted, about 5 minutes. Add the sesame seeds and cook another 2 minutes. Stir the red chile peppers, curry leaves, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds into the mixture; continue cooking until the seeds are roasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and spread the mixture on a baking sheet to cool.",
        "Grind the mixture into a medium-fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Season with salt. The powder will keep in an airtight container on the shelf for a few months."
