        "If using wooden skewers, soak in water at least 20 minutes. Whisk first 5 ingredients and 1/4 cup oil in a bowl. Add chicken, arranging to make sure liquid covers all pieces. Cover with plastic wrap. Marinate 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk together remaining 1/4 cup oil and vinegar and brush liberally on vegetables; reserve remaining liquid to use as salad dressing. On a wooden or metal skewer, thread (in any order you like) a piece each of onion, zucchini, chicken and squash, then repeat for remaining skewers. Season with pepper. Coat grill with cooking spray. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Cook kebabs about 7 1/2 minutes per side or until chicken is firm and cooked through. Toss greens with remaining oil and vinegar mixture. Add salt and pepper. Divide greens among 4 plates. Place 2 kebabs on each plate. Garnish with tomatoes and serve immediately."
