        "Place the steaks on the preheated grill, and immediately turn after 30 seconds (this first turn is to  ensure that one side is seared). Place the fresh rosemary sprigs on top. Cook 7 minutes per side, to desired doneness, remembering to remove the rosemary sprigs before turning, and to replace on top of the meat after turning."
