        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add half of mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and starting to crisp, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining mushrooms. Return all mushrooms to skillet (reserve bowl) and add shallot, wine, and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until skillet is dry, about 5 minutes. Return mushrooms to bowl.",
        "Combine ricotta and cream in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.",
        "Working in batches, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just softened, about 30 seconds. (If using dried noodles, cook until al dente.) Transfer noodles to a large rimmed baking sheet as you go, brushing with oil and overlapping as needed.",
        "Spread a thin layer of ricotta mixture in a small baking dish and top with a pasta sheet (if using dried, use 2 noodles side by side). Spread a large spoonful of ricotta mixture over pasta, scatter some mushrooms over, then a few pieces of burrata. Top evenly with some Parmesan and 1 teaspoon marjoram leaves. Repeat layering process (starting with noodles and ending with marjoram) 5 more times; finish with the last of the Parmesan and a grind or two of pepper.",
        "Cover lasagnette with foil and bake until warmed through, 10\u201315 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown, 15\u201320 minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, toss kale in a large bowl with vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to coat and massage leaves just to soften slightly; season with salt and pepper. Serve lasagnette with kale alongside.",
        "Lasagnette can be assembled 1 day ahead. Cover and chill."
