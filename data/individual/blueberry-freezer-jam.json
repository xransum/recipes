        "Stir sugar and blueberries together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "Stir lemon juice and pectin together in a separate small bowl; add to blueberry mixture. Stir constantly until sugar is completely dissolved and no longer grainy, about 3 minutes.",
        "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the blueberry into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours until set.",
        "Refrigerate for up to 3 weeks or freeze for up to 1 year. Thaw in refrigerator."
