        "Blanch carrots in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Transfer carrots to bowl of ice water using slotted spoon.  Return water to boil.  Add sprouts and blanch until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to another bowl of ice water.  Drain vegetables, and refrigerate if making ahead.",
        "Bring stock, butter or margarine, and brown sugar to a boil in a heavy large skillet.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Boil until reduced by half, about 7 minutes.  Can be prepared 6 hours ahead; return to boil before continuing. Add carrots.  Cook until almost tender and sauce begins to coat, shaking pan occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Add Brussels sprouts and pepper.  Cook until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes."
