        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spray large baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Mix flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in medium bowl; set aside. Coarsely chop hazelnuts in processor. Transfer to small bowl. Combine sugar and butter in processor; blend until fluffy. Add orange peel and vanilla extract and blend well. Add eggs 1 at a time, blending just until incorporated after each addition. Add flour mixture; mix using on/off turns until just blended. Mix in hazelnuts using on/off turns until just blended.",
        "Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 9-inch-long, 2-inch-wide log. Space logs 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Flatten each to 12-inch-long, 2 1/2-inch-wide log. Bake until very light golden and firm to touch, about 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes. Maintain oven temperature.",
        "Using metal spatula, transfer logs to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into 3/4-inch-wide slices. Place slices, cut side down, on large baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes. Turn biscotti over; bake until light golden and firm, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer biscotti to racks and cool. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)"
