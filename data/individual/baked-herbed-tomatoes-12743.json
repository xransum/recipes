        "Sprinkle the insides of the tomatoes with salt, arrange the tomato halves, cut sides down, on layers of paper towels, and let them drain for 1 hour. In a bowl stir together the bread crumbs, the onion, the garlic, the basil, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and stir in the oil. Arrange the tomato halves, cut sides up, in a shallow baking pan and divide the bread crumb mixture among them. The tomatoes may be prepared up to this point 4 hours in advance and kept at room temperature.",
        "Bake the tomatoes in the upper third of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven for 10 minutes, or until the topping is golden. (Do not over-cook the tomatoes or they will lose their shape.)"
