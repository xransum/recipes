        "Pull meat from chicken; discard skin. Warm chicken and salsa in a large skillet over medium-low heat until heated through.",
        "Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 1 minute. Add beans, salt, and 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring and crushing beans with the back of a large spoon, until warmed through and creamy, about 3 minutes. Let sit until ready to use.",
        "Working one at a time, warm tortillas with tongs directly over a gas burner, turning often, until lightly charred and puffed in spots, about 1 minute per side. (Alternatively, wrap tortillas in foil and heat in a 350\u00b0F oven until warmed through, or wrap in damp paper towels and microwave in 20-second bursts until warm.) Transfer to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm.",
        "Fill tortillas with chicken and top with avocado, slaw, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, hot sauce, and refried beans alongside."
