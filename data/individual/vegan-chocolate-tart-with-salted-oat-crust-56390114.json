        "Dissolve espresso powder in 3/4 cup very hot water in a food processor. Add cocoa and let sit 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, agave syrup, vanilla, 2/3 cup coconut oil, and 2/3 teaspoon kosher salt and process until mixture is very smooth and thick, about 30 seconds.",
        "Scrape filling into cooled tart shell and smooth top (if making tart in a rectangular shell, you may have a little filling left over; save for another use, like truffles). Tap tart lightly against counter to pop any air bubbles in filling.",
        "Cook oats and remaining 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a small skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until oats are toasted, about 3 minutes. Gradually add half of demerara sugar, stirring constantly, until sugar is melted, then remove from heat and stir in remaining demerara sugar just to coat. Season with kosher salt; let oat mixture cool.",
        "Scatter oat mixture over tart, sprinkle with sea salt, and chill until filling is set, at least 1 hour.",

        "Tart can be made 2 days ahead. Once filling is set, cover and keep chilled."
