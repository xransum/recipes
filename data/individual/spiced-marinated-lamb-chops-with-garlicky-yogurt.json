        "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Wipe off excess marinade from lamb chops and cook half until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side (the yogurt in the marinade will help them take on color quickly). Remove chops from skillet and pour off fat (no need to wipe it out). Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining chops.",
