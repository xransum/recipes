Grill steak, turning occasionally and moving to a cooler spot on grill as needed to control flare-ups, until nicely browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130\u00b0F, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.",
