        "Place the steak strips in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in the pineapple juice mixture and seal the bag. Turn the bag gently to evenly coat steak with the marinade. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours.",
        "Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.",
        "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Remove steak strips from marinade and place in the skillet. Cook and stir the steak strips until browned and no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm.",
        "Place the pineapple chunks in a separate skillet. Cook over medium heat until slightly soft and heated through, about 4 minutes. To serve, divide the rice between two bowls, top with steak strips and pineapple chunks, and toss briefly."
