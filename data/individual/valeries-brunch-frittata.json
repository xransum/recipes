        "Warm the oil in a medium (10-inch) nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus and cherry tomatoes and saute until warmed through. Add the eggs, stir and let cook until firm around the edges. With a spatula, lift the edges and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked portion of the egg to run into the bare pan beneath the spatula. Add the goat cheese and herbs, stir slightly to incorporate, and continue to cook until the edges of the frittata are firm (the center will still be jiggly).",
        "Transfer the pan to the broiler and cook until golden brown on top, about 2 minutes. Allow to sit for 2 minutes, then run a knife or a thin spatula around the edge of the frittata. Cut in wedges and serve straight out of the skillet or slide it out of the pan onto a cutting board, cut in wedges and serve."
