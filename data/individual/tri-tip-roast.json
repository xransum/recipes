        "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil all over the bottom of a roasting pan.",
        "Place meat in the prepared roasting pan.",
        "Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue roasting meat until hot and slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain."
