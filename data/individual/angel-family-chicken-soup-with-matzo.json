        "Whisk together eggs and oil in a medium-sized mixing bowl.",

        "Remove matzo mixture from the refrigerator and gently hand-roll into 1 inch balls. Be careful not to over-roll as this can make the matzo balls tough.",
        "In a separate pot, heat chicken stock. Place matzo balls into the stock and simmer until they are soft, at least 1 hour.",
        "Transfer the matzo balls into the soup pot with the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
