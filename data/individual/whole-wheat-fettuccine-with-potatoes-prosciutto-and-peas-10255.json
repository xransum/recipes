        "In a large kettle of boiling salted water cook the potatoes, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices or into 1/4-inch dice, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are tender, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving the water for cooking the fettuccine. In a large heavy skillet cook the garlic, the onion, the red pepper flakes, and the rosemary in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is soft and add the broth, the wine, and the peas. Simmer the mixture for 3 minutes, or until the peas are tender, and stir in the prosciutto, the potatoes, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the reserved water in the kettle to a boil and in it cook the fettuccine until it is al dente. Drain the pasta and in a large bowl toss it with the potato mixture and the Parmesan."
