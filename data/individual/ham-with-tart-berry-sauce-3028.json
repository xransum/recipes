Transfer ham to plates; tent with foil to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to same skillet. Add shallots and mustard and stir until shallots begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Mix in lingonberries, water and red wine vinegar. Stir until sauce thickens, about 1 minute; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over ham and serve."
