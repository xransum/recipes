        "Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms and onions until onions begin to turn translucent and mushrooms release some liquid, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minutes. Add flour, stirring constantly, until thoroughly incorporated in the butter and begins to bubble, about 2 minutes.",

Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce and continue cooking until mixture begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Mix in turkey and peas. Remove from heat.",
