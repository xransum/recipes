Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Pour in the wine, half-and-half, and jalapeno cheese food. Bring to a simmer; add the crawfish tails and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Season with Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture into a 9x13 inch casserole dish, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the dish is bubbly, about 20 minutes.",
        "While the crawfish is baking, fill a large pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccini and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Serve the crawfish over the hot pasta."
