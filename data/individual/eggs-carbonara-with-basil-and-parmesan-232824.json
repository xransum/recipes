        "Cook bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, turning over occasionally, until crisp, then transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in a small bowl and discard remainder. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels and reserve. When cool, finely crumble bacon.",
        "While bacon cools, vigorously whisk together eggs, parmesan, cream, basil, salt, and pepper in a bowl until foamy.",
        "Cook garlic and parsley in reserved bacon fat in skillet over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute (do not brown garlic). Add scallions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally to scramble eggs and form large curds, lifting up cooked egg around edge with a heatproof rubber spatula to let raw egg flow underneath, until eggs are just set. Stir in crumbled bacon, top with chopped scallions and basil, and serve immediately."
