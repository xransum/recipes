        "Mix 1 tablespoon chili powder, salt, and pepper in bowl. Rub spice mixture all over pork. Saut\u00e9 bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Working in batches, add pork to drippings in pot and saut\u00e9 until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl.",
        "Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, ham, carrot, and garlic to pot; cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits. Add chilies; stir 1 minute. Stir in hominy, tomatoes with juices, beer, broth, marjoram, pork, and remaining 2 teaspoons chili powder and bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until pork is very tender, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill bacon. Cool stew slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)",
        "Simmer stew uncovered until liquid is slightly reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with reserved bacon and cilantro.",
        "These fresh green chilies, often called pasillas, are available at Latin American markets and also at some supermarkets."
