        "Bring cream, 1 cup sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt to a gentle simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Cook 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in lemon juice. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a medium bowl and press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto surface (this will help prevent a skin from forming). Chill lemon cream until it has set up to a pudding-like consistency, at least 12 hours.",
        "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Combine gluten-free flour, butter, brown sugar, basil, vanilla, and a pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work mixture until it comes together in small clumps. Scatter crumble on a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and slightly firm, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool and break into smaller pieces. Mix in granola.",
        "Increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0F. Toss strawberries, smoked salt, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar on a clean rimmed baking sheet to combine. Roast strawberries, tossing once, until they are juicy but still hold their shape, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly.",
        "Just before serving, assemble trifles by spooning alternating layers of lemon cream, roasted strawberries, and granola crumble into 8\u201312-oz. glasses or jars, dividing evenly. Top off with some mint and basil leaves.",
        "Lemon cream can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled."
