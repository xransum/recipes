    "directions": [
        "Beat coconut milk and egg together in a bowl until smooth. Spread coconut flakes into a separate shallow bowl.",
        "Place chicken between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thick.",
        "Dip chicken into the beaten egg mixture and immediately press into coconut flakes to coat. Gently toss between your hands so any flakes that haven't stuck can fall away. Place chicken onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack.",
        "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken in melted butter until lightly browned and crispy on the outside, chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
