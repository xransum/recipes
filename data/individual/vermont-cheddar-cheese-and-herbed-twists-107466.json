Sprinkle 1/3 of cheese mixture evenly over half of pastry; fold plain half of pastry over cheese, forming 10x9-inch rectangle; press to adhere. Repeat 2 more times, rolling to 18x10-inch rectangle, sprinkling with 1/3 of cheese mixture, and folding. Roll out pastry again to 18x10-inch rectangle. Transfer to unlined baking sheet.

Cut pastry crosswise in half, forming two 10x9-inch rectangles. Trim and discard uneven edges of pastry. Cut each rectangle crosswise into scant 1/2-inch-wide strips. Twist each strip a few times and place on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch apart, dabbing ends lightly with water and pressing to adhere to parchment.",

Cover twists on sheets tightly with foil and store at room temperature. If desired, rewarm uncovered in 350\u00b0F oven until heated through, about 5 minutes.)",
