        "Add the chicken soup, mushroom soup, water or broth, salt and pepper, sage and garlic. Do not add the tomatoes yet as they retard cooking time. Bring all to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 more minutes, uncovered. Serve over hot cooked rice if desired. Delicious!"
