        "In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and 1 cup sugar until soft and smooth. Stir in the lemon juice and vanilla. Scrape the bottom of the bowl occasionally with a spatula to prevent lumps. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then fold in the toffee bits. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place the foil covered pan into a larger cake pan or any pan with at least 1 inch tall sides. Put into the oven, then fill the larger pan with water, creating a water bath.",
        "Bake for 90 minutes in the preheated oven, checking after 45 minutes to refill the water bath. After 90 minutes, turn off the oven and leave the cake inside for about an hour. Chill at least 4 hours before removing from pan."
