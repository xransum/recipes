        "Broil the jalape\u00f1os on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat, turning them every 5 minutes, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the skins are blistered and charred. Transfer the jalape\u00f1os to a bowl and let them stand, covered tightly, until they are cool enough to handle. Wearing rubber gloves, peel the jalape\u00f1os, cut off the tops, and discard all but 1 teaspoon of the seeds. In a blender puree the jalape\u00f1os with the seeds, the oil, the lime juice, the water, the garlic, the parsley, and salt to taste. The puree may be made 3 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.",
        "In a kettle cook the onion and the celery in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the celery is softened, add the broth, the water, the potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/8-inch cubes, and the ham, and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes. Stir in the corn and the thyme and simmer the chowder for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. In a blender or food processor pur\u00e9e 2 cups of the chowder and stir the pur\u00e9e into the remaining chowder.",
        "Serve the chowder with a small dollop of the jalape\u00f1o and parsley puree swirled into it."
