        "Place frozen chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and cover with salad dressing. Seal bag and place in refrigerator and marinate until chicken is thawed (marinating frozen breasts until thawed permeates the meat with the dressing flavors).",
        "Lightly oil grill and preheat to high heat.",
        "Remove chicken breasts from marinade and grill 5 to 7 minutes each side, until they are barely done. Coat with barbecue sauce and cook just a few minutes more. Don't overcook, but check to make sure that the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear."
