        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place six 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes on baking sheet. Mash sugar and lime peel in small bowl. Stir chopped chocolate in medium bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted. Remove from over water; whisk in yolks, 2 tablespoons lime-sugar, and salt (mixture will become thick). Beat egg whites in large bowl to soft peaks; add 2 tablespoons lime-sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into chocolate mixture to lighten; fold in remaining whites in 2 additions. Fold in chocolate chips. Fill dishes with souffl\u00e9 mixture, dividing equally.
