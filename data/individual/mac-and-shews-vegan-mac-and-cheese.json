        "Blend cashews, broth, yeast, lemon juice, miso, and onion powder in a high-powered blender (such as a Vitamix(R)), scraping down sides with a spatula until completely smooth. Season with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that you want it just a little saltier than usual because it's going to be poured over other ingredients.",
        "Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.",
        "Drain, return to pot, and stir in cashew sauce. Cook over low heat, stirring, until sauce thickens a bit and everything is deliciously creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in arugula (if using) and add more salt, if needed. Serve immediately."
