Pour the mixture onto a floured surface; roll with a floured rolling pin until the mixture is approximately 1 inch thick. You may need to sprinkle extra flour on top, given the stickiness of the mixture. Cut into rounds and place on a floured baking sheet with each round a few centimeters apart.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the scones are lightly browned and sound slightly hollow if you tap them, about 15 minutes."
