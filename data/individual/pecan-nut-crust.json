        "Place pie crust on a cookie sheet, and position on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  WATCH it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they DON'T have to turn black to taste burnt!   Cool completely before filling."
