        "Stir together flour and salt in a large bowl, then make a well in center and add water, yogurt, 1/2 cup oil, and vinegar. Stir until a soft dough forms, then knead on a work surface (do not dust with flour) until smooth and pliable, about 4 minutes. Form dough into a ball and put in an oiled bowl, then turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough stand at room temperature 1 hour.",
        "Wash leeks in a bowl of cold water, agitating them, then lift out and drain well in a colander.",
        "Heat 1/4 cup oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet or a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 leeks and celery with 1/2 teaspoon salt, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.",
        "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",

        "Brush baking pan with 2 tablespoons oil.",
        "Divide dough in half. Roll out 1 half on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 19- by 14-inch rectangle. Fold rectangle loosely into quarters and transfer to baking pan, then unfold dough and fit into pan, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Spread filling evenly in pan.",
        "Roll out remaining dough on floured surface with floured rolling pin into a 20- by 15-inch rectangle. Lift dough and drape it over filling, leaving it slightly wrinkled. Roll edge of bottom crust over top to form a rope edge all around pie. Brush top of pie with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Score top crust into serving pieces with a sharp knife (mark crust but do not cut through it).",
