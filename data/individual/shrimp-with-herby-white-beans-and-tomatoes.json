Add tomatoes with their juices, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1/4 cup water. Increase heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add beans and 1/4 cup Roasted Garlic Herb Sauce, and cook, stirring, until warmed through, 1\u20132 minutes. Taste and adjust salt if needed, then divide bean mixture between 2 large, shallow bowls.",
