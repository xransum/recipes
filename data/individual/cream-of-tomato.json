        "In a saucepan, heat the tomatoes and cut them in small pieces. (If you use the fresh ones, put the tomatoes into a boiling bath until the peel cracks. Peel them and proceed the same way)",
        "Heat the 2 cups of milk in another saucepan.",
        "Mix flour, salt, pepper, sugar and 1/4 cup milk in a small dish until smooth. Stir the flour mixture into the simmering milk until it thickens. DO NOT BOIL.",
        "Stir the baking soda into the hot tomatoes. When the fizzing slows down, add slowly to the hot milk. Simmer a few minutes, adding basil, oregano, and marjoram to taste.",
        "Note: If you want a creamy cream of tomato, you will have to put your tomatoes through a sieve or a food processor before you mix them with the milk."
