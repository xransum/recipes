        "In a food processor, mix together flour and salt. Add butter, and process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time. Pulse briefly until dough begins to form in clumps. Remove dough from processor onto a floured surface, and form into a ball. Allow dough to rest at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before rolling out.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to fit pie pan. Place in pan, and crimp edge. Prick the bottom of dough several times with a fork. Place in freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).",
        "Fill crust with beans, or use pie weights. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove pie weights, and bake another 5 minutes. If necessary, cover with foil to prevent overbrowning."
