        "Place the beets and potatoes in separate bowls, each with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak until you need them.",
        "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the lentils, mustard seed, cumin seed, and red chile peppers in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter, about 30 seconds. Stir the asafoetida and curry leaves into the mixture and cook another few seconds.",
        "Drain the beets and potatoes and add to the skillet. Cook and stir until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking until the potatoes and beets are soft, about 20 minutes more. If there is excess water in the pan, increase the heat to high and cook until the water evaporates completely. Stir the red pepper and coconut into the mixture and serve immediately."
