        "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bell pepper and onion in the hot oil until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, meatballs, and water to the pot; bring to a boil. Stir the macaroni into the mixture and cook until the macaroni is cooked through, yet firm to the bite, 15 to 20 minutes."
