        "In a large skillet, saut\u00e9 the onion in the oil until soft. Add the garlic, carrots, and celery; saut\u00e9 3 minutes. Add the bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o peppers; saut\u00e9 3 to 5 minutes longer.",
        "Combine the saut\u00e9ed vegetables and cooked beans in a large pot. Add the herbs, spices, salt, lemon juice, and chocolate. Pour in about 1 1/2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid or as needed to keep the chili loose. Simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "As the chili simmers, place the pumpkin seeds in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Dry-toast them, stirring and tossing until the seeds glisten and begin to brown. Sprinkle a few drops of soy sauce on them and allow them to cool.",
        "Serve in bowls with the pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top. Add sour cream and/or grated cheese, if desired."
