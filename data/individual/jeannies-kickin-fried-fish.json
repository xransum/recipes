        "Beat the egg with milk in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, roasted onion flakes, garlic, blackened seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and sea salt.",
        "Dip a tilapia fillet into the egg mixture, then press gently into the crumb mixture on both sides; set the coated fillet onto a plate. Repeat with remaining fillets; refrigerate the coated fillets for about 15 minutes to help set the crumbs.",
        "Heat the olive oil and butter in a cast-iron frying pan over medium heat. Lay the fillets into the skillet, and pan-fry until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. The fish should be opaque and flaky underneath the coating. Remove and drain fillets on paper towels."
