        "Pat veal cutlets dry. With a knife mince and mash garlic to a paste with salt. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon garlic paste on one side of 1 veal cutlet and arrange 3 sage leaves in one layer over paste. Cover veal cutlet with 2 slices prosciutto and secure prosciutto and sage with 3 wooden picks. Arrange veal cutlet, prosciutto side down, on a tray and season with pepper. Prepare more saltimbocca in same manner.",
        "In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke and saut\u00e9 2 veal cutlets, prosciutto sides down, 30 seconds. Turn veal cutlets over and saut\u00e9 15 seconds more, or until veal is just cooked through. Transfer saltimbocca with tongs to a platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Saut\u00e9 remaining veal cutlets and keep warm in same manner.",
        "Pour off oil from skillet and return skillet to high heat. Add wine carefully and deglaze skillet, scraping up brown bits. Boil wine until reduced to about 1/3 cup.",
