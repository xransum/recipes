        "1. Halve the peppers lengthwise. Remove the seeds and ribs and place flat on a baking sheet, skin-side up. Place under the broiler and char the skins. Seal tightly in a plastic bag to steam for about 15 to 20 minutes. Slip off and discard the skins. Cut the peppers into 1-inch squares.",
        "2. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy skillet; add the peppers, tomatoes, garlic, sugar, paprika, salt and pepper. Simmer over a low flame, stirring occasionally, and mash the vegetables with a fork until the liquid begins to evaporate. Continue to cook until the salad thickens and has a saucelike consistency.",
        "3. Serve at room temperature, drizzled with the remaining tablespoon of oil."
