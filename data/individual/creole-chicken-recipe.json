Add tomatoes with green chile peppers, water, tomato sauce, and Spanish-style rice mix to the same skillet; stir well. Return chicken to the rice mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 40 minutes. Serve on a platter with chicken atop the rice."
