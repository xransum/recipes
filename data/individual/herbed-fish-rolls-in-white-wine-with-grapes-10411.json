        "Reserve 8 of the grapes, halve the remaining grapes, and in a small saucepan let the grape halves macerate in the wine for 1 hour. Halve the fillets lengthwise, season them with salt and pepper, and sprinkle the skinned sides with the parsley and the thyme. Roll up each fillet half with 1 of the reserved grapes in the middle and secure it with a wooden pick. Stand the fish rolls up in a saucepan just large enough to hold them in one layer without crowding them. Transfer the macerated grapes with a slotted spoon to a small bowl, bring the wine to a boil, and pour it over the fish rolls. Cook the fish rolls, covered, at a bare simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they just flake. Transfer the fish rolls with a slotted spoon to a plate, reserving the cooking liquid, and keep them warm, covered.",
        "In a small saucepan cook the onion in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, stir in the flour, and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and strain the reserved cooking liquid through a fine sieve into the pan. Add the cream, the macerated grapes, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste and boil the sauce, stirring for 3 minutes. Pour off any liquid that has accumulated on the plate, divide the fish rolls among 4 heated plates, and spoon the sauce over them."
