        "Line bottom of pie crust with one banana, sliced.  Fill pie shell with filling until level with top, using about half of the prepared filling.  Top with slices of second banana.  Pile on the rest of the filling, shaping with rubber spatula to form a high center cone; the higher the pie, the more spectacular.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour until thoroughly chilled.",
