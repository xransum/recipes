        "Meanwhile, stir the chocolate chips evenly into the raspberry sherbet. Scoop the raspberry sherbet into the lime sherbet shell, smoothing off and leveling the top. Return bowl to the freezer.",
        "To serve, invert the bowl onto a serving plate. Lift off bowl and remove plastic wrap. Freeze again for 1 hour if the sherbet is too soft. Slice pieces like a watermelon."
