        "In a small bowl, stir together the sherry, soy sauce and chile paste. Cut the bok choy lengthwise into halves or quarters, depending on size.",
        "In a wok or a large fry pan over high heat, warm 1 1/2 tsp. of the oil. Add the bok choy and stir-fry just until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.",
        "Warm the remaining 1/2 tsp. oil in the wok. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant but not browned, 15 to 30 seconds. Add the beef and cook, stirring, just until no longer pink, about 2 minutes.",
        "Return the bok choy to the wok, add the sherry mixture and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
