        "Heat 4 cups canola oil in a 2-quart pot to 375\u00b0F. Working in batches, deep-fry the cubes of tofu until golden brown, making sure they don't stick to each other. Wait between batches for oil to return to 375\u00b0. Drain tofu on paper towels.",
        "Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 3 tablespoons canola oil. Add onion and garlic, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring carefully, just until tomatoes begin start to break down, about 1 to 2 minutes. Deglaze with mirin and cook for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tofu and green onions, stir, and season with salt to taste."
