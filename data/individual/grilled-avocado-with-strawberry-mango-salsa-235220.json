        "1. Preheat a well-oiled grill to medium-high, 300\u00b0F to 400\u00b0F.",
        "2. Slice the avocados in half lengthwise, and carefully remove the pit; do not peel them. In a small bowl, mix the honey with the oil. Brush the avocado flesh with this mixture, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (do not refrigerate).",
        "3. In a medium bowl, mix the mango and strawberries with the vinegar, orange juice, and lemon juice. Let the mixture rest for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, so the flavors can blend.",
        "4. Grill the avocados, skin side down, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the skin begins to lightly char and take on grill marks. Brush the flesh side of the avocados again with the honey-oil mixture and place them, flesh side down, on the hot grill for another 2 or 3 minutes.",
        "5. With a spatula, carefully remove the avocados from the grill and place them on a bed of lettuce on a serving plate, 2 halves per person. Fill the seed cavity with mango-strawberry salsa, generously dribbling some on top of each half. Serve with a spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh and salsa."
