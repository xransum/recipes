        "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle.",
        "Roast hazelnuts on a baking sheet in oven until fragrant and pale golden inside (cut one open to test), 8 to 10 minutes (keep oven on). Wrap hot nuts in a towel and rub together to remove any loose skins. Halve nuts.",
        "While nuts are roasting, cook pancetta in a 9- to 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.",
        "Increase oven to 425\u00b0F with rack in middle. Lightly oil baking sheet.",
        "Halve squash lengthwise and seed. Use vegetable peeler to peel squash into long thin ribbons into a large bowl. Toss squash with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a large bowl until coated. Spread ribbons evenly on a 13- by 9-inch baking sheet, or arrange ribbons into a 13- by 9-inch rectangle on a larger baking sheet. Bake until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, then turn on broiler and broil until lightly browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
        "Bring cider to a boil in a small saucepan, then boil until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Whisk reduced cider with cider vinegar, shallot, Dijon mustard, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add 1/2 cup oil in a slow stream, whisking, and whisk until emulsified.",
        "Toss arugula and chicory in a very large bowl with about 1/2 cup vinaigrette (there will be some left over). Then toss in pancetta and hazelnuts.",
        "Cut squash into 8 rectangles and carefully transfer each with a metal spatula to a plate. Divide salad among plates and drizzle a little of remaining vinaigrette on squash."
