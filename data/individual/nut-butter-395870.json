        "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or just until they begin to brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the nuts to cool slightly.",
        "2. Place the nuts, salt, and honey in the bowl of the food processor fit with the chopping blade. Blend for 20 seconds. With the motor still running, drizzle 3 tablespoons of oil into the bowl through the chute in the lid, and process for 30 seconds. If the nut butter is still dry, continue to blend and add the additional tablespoon of oil. Process for up to another minute to reach your desired consistency. Taste and adjust for salt, if needed."
