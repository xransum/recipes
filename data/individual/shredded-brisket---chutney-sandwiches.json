        "In a slow cooker, combine the tomatoes, broth, wine, onion, garlic, oregano, 1 tsp. salt and several grinds of pepper. Stir well and top with the brisket. Cover and cook on the low setting for 8 hours, turning the brisket over halfway through if possible. The brisket should be very tender.",
        "Transfer the brisket to a platter and let rest for a few minutes. Then, using 2 forks, shred the meat. Strain the braising liquid, skim away the fat, and drizzle just enough liquid over the shredded meat to moisten it. Reserve the remaining liquid for another use or discard.",
        "Split each focaccia square horizontally. Spread a thick layer of chutney on each focaccia bottom. Top each sandwich with some of the shredded brisket and the watercress, and close with the focaccia tops, pressing down gently. Cut each sandwich in half on the diagonal and serve. Serves 6.",
