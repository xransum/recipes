        "Cut shortening into 2 cups flour and salt until the shortening is the size of small peas. Sprinkle in water 1 tablespoon at a time until flour is moistened.  Gather into a ball, wrap with plastic, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Divide the dough in half and roll out half on a lightly floured board. Line a 9-inch pie dish with the pastry. Roll out the top crust and set aside.",
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).",
        "Mix sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and cinnamon. Stir in berries to coat. Pour the filling into the pastry-lined pan. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dot with butter. Cover with top crust; cut slits in the top to vent the steam. Seal the crust and flute the edges.",
        "Cover the edges of the crust with foil to prevent over-browning. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove foil during the last 12 minutes of baking."
