        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg; set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth, then stir in the molasses. Add the sifted ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, mixing well after each addition. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. If the dough is too soft, more flour can be added. Cut out cookies using cookie cutters and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.",
        "Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely."
