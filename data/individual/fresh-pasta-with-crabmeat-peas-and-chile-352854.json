Add 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water, peas, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and cook 1 minute. Add crab and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add pasta, lemon juice, cheese, chile, and remaining tablespoon each of oil and butter and stir to combine well, adding more cooking water to moisten if necessary. Remove from heat and stir in all but 1 tablespoon parsley. Serve pasta sprinkled with remaining parsley.",
