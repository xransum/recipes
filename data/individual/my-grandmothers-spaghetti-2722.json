        "Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add ground beef and cook until brown, breaking up with fork, about 8 minutes. Drain drippings from Dutch oven. Mix parsley, bay leaves and basil into beef and cook 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, water, tomato sauce and tomato paste. Simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, breaking up tomatoes with spoon, about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat before using.)",

Serve immediately, passing Parmesan cheese separately. (Refrigerate or freeze remaining sauce for another use.)"
