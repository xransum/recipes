        "Mix together salt and flour, and rub mixture into the meat. In a Dutch oven, cook garlic in butter over medium heat. Place meat into pan, and brown on all sides. Remove beef from pan.",
        "Arrange sliced onions in the bottom of the Dutch oven, and then place the meat on top of the onions. Season with peppercorns, allspice, horseradish, and bay leaf. Pour in rum. Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until tender, about 3 to 4 hours. A good pot roast will supply most of its own juices, but as it cooks pour 1/2 cup water over it to make an ample supply of gravy.",
        "Transfer roast to a platter. Stir gravy until smooth, and pour over roast."
