        "While beets are roasting, stir together vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cut apples into 1/4-inch dice and add to dressing along with horseradish. Toss well.",
        "When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins and remove stems. Cut beets into 1/4-inch dice and stir into apple mixture.",
        "Chill relish, covered, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop) and up to 3 days."
