        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.",

        "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat and stir in drained matzos; stir until mixture is dry and slightly brown. Remove from heat, and mix in eggs, salt and pepper to taste, parsley, and onions.",
        "Mix in just enough matzo meal to make mixture hold together. Roll one golf ball-size matzo ball.  Place matzo ball in the boiling water to test the mixture. The ball must rise to the top of the water and not break apart.  If it does not rise, then too much matzo meal was added.  In this case, add another beaten egg to the mixture and try again. When desired consistency is reached, roll all of mixture into golf ball size spheres.",
        "In a large saucepan, bring chicken broth to a slow boil over medium heat; add balls to broth. Serve soup as the balls rise to the top of the broth."
