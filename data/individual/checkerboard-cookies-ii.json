        "Roll out each half of the dough into a rectangle, 8x10 inches. Slice each rectangle lengthwise into 8-1x10 inch strips. Place two strips of opposing colors next to each other. Place two more on top of those, placing opposing colors on top of each other. Repeat until the checkerboard is four strips high. Repeat with remaining strips.
