        "Working with 1 artichoke at a time, remove the tough outer leaves to expose the light yellow core. Using a knife, trim off the top. Using a spoon, remove the choke. Trim the stem end and cut the artichoke lengthwise into slices 1/4 inch thick. Place in a bowl and add half of the buttermilk to coat. Place the lemon slices in another bowl and coat with the remaining buttermilk.",
        "In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, semolina flour and the 2 tsp. salt. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, pour in oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 375\u00b0F on a deep-frying thermometer. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.",
        "Working in batches, drain the artichokes well. Coat with the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Fry the artichokes until golden and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Repeat with the lemons, frying them for 1 to 3 minutes.",
        "Arrange the artichokes and lemons on a warmed platter and serve with aioli. Serves 4 to 6.",
