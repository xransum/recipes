        "To prepare the dough, in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the yeast, water and sugar and whisk by hand until dissolved. Let stand for 5 minutes, then add the vegetable oil, flour and salt. Place the bowl on the mixer, attach the dough hook and knead on low speed until smooth and pliable, about 5 minutes.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide into 4 equal pieces. Knead each piece by hand for 30 seconds, shaping the dough into a ball and dusting with a little flour if needed. Dust a baking sheet with flour and place the dough on the sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, prepare the topping: In a fry pan over medium heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the bell peppers, salt and pepper, and cook until soft and lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl.",
        "Return the pan to medium heat, add the sausage and cook, breaking the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a separate bowl.",
        "Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F.",
        "Divide the remaining olive oil among 4 mini deep-dish pizza pans (about 2 tsp. per pan), thoroughly greasing each pan. Place a dough ball in each pan and, using your fingers, press the dough in an even layer across the bottom and up the sides of the pans.",
        "Place 1 provolone slice on each dough round. Top with the mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, bell peppers and sausage, dividing evenly. Using the back of a spoon, spread 1/2 cup of the tomato pizza sauce on top of each pizza. If desired, place more toppings on the sauce.",
        "Bake the pizzas until the crusts are golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the pizzas from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Makes 4 mini deep-dish pizzas."
