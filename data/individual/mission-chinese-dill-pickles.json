        "Combine the cucumbers and onions in a medium bowl and salt them generously. They should be as salty as you want your final pickles\u2014about as salty as a potato chip. Add the garlic, dill, and spices and toss to mix. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.",
        "The next day, drain off any liquid that has leached out of the onions and cucumbers. Douse the vegetables with the white vinegar and marinate, covered, for 3 to 4 hours in the fridge.",
        "Drain off the vinegar and store the pickles, covered, in the fridge. They\u2019ll last for a week. Add more chopped dill before serving."
