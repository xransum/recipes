        "Cut the beef across the grain into 1/4-inch slices. In a bowl, combine 2 Tbs. of the tamari and 3/4 tsp. of the sugar and stir to dissolve. Mix in half of the green onions, 1 1/2 tsp. of the sesame oil and a generous amount of black pepper. Add the beef and stir to coat. Set aside.",
        "In a food processor, combine the peanut butter, ginger, vinegar, red pepper flakes, the remaining 3 Tbs. tamari, the remaining green onions, 1 Tbs. of the sesame oil and the remaining 1 tsp. sugar. Add the hot water and process until well blended to make a sauce.",
        "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spaghetti and stir well. Cook, stirring frequently, until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse briefly with cold water and drain well. Place in a warmed bowl. Add the remaining 1 Tbs. sesame oil and stir to coat. Stir in the bell pepper and sauce to taste. Stir to coat the noodles, then season with salt and black pepper.",
        "In a large, heavy fry pan over high heat, warm the vegetable oil. Working in batches, sear the beef in a single layer, about 20 seconds per side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut each piece in half lengthwise. Divide the noodles among 4 bowls, top with the beef and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve immediately. Serves 4.",
