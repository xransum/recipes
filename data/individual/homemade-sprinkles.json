        "Pulse raspberries in a food processor until finely ground (you should have a scant 1/4 cup). Sift powdered sugar and raspberry powder through a very fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard raspberry seeds.",
        "Whisk dried egg whites and 1 Tbsp. warm water in a small bowl until frothy. Whisk in salt.",
        "Pour egg white mixture into raspberry mixture and stir with a spatula until thick but fully incorporated. Stir in lemon extract. Mixture should be smooth, satiny, and very thick; if it seems too stiff to stir, add 1/2 tsp. water.",
        "Fit a pastry bag with a #2 round icing tip, if using. Transfer mixture to pastry bag or plastic bag (cut off 1 corner before piping to make a very small opening). Pipe long, straight lines, small hearts, dots, letters, or any other favorite shape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet.",
        "Let sit at room temperature until hardened, at least 8 hours or up to 1 day (to speed up drying, you can also bake sprinkles in a 150\u00b0F oven 2\u20132 1/2 hours). Break sprinkles piped into lines into various lengths, if desired.",
        "Sprinkles can be made 1 week ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature."
