        "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Place eight 2/3-cup ramekins or custard cups on work surface. Stir 1 1/3 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 8 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into ramekins. Using oven mitts as aid, pick up each ramekin and tilt and rotate to coat sides with caramel. Place ramekins in large roasting pan.",
        "Using back of spoon, mash 1/2 cup sugar and lime peel in large bowl until sugar is moist and fragrant. Add eggs and yolks; whisk to blend. Bring cream and milk to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk cream mixture into egg mixture. Whisk in vanilla and salt. Ladle custard into caramel-lined ramekins. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.",
        "Bake flans until just set and beginning to color on top, about 45 minutes. Remove from water; let cool 45 minutes. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
        "Cut around sides of ramekins to loosen flans. Invert flans onto plates. Garnish with lime slices, if desired."
