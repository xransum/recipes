        "Place radishes in a small bowl. Bring white wine vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 3/4 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Immediately pour brine over radishes and let cool. Cover and chill at least 2 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, rinse rice until water runs clear (this removes surface starch and keeps rice from getting gummy). Combine rice and 1 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan, season with 1 1/2 tsp. salt and let sit 30 minutes.",
        "Bring rice to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 18\u201322 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (still covered) 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork; keep warm.",
        "Soak hijiki in 1/2 cup cold water in a small bowl until softened, 10\u201312 minutes. Drain; set aside.",
        "Bring a medium pot of water to a boil; season generously with salt. Add shrimp, cover pot, and remove from heat. Let sit until shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain and transfer shrimp to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and pat dry; cut into 1/2\" pieces. Set aside.",
        "Whisk shallot, soy sauce, gochujang, rice vinegar, fish sauce, honey, and oil in a large bowl. Add reserved hijiki and shrimp to honey-gochujang dressing; toss to coat. Cover; chill 1 hour. Taste and season with more salt if needed.",
        "Divide rice among bowls and top with shrimp mixture, drained pickled radishes, and mizuna. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.",
        "Radishes can be pickled 5 days ahead; keep chilled. Shrimp can be cooked 8 hours ahead; cover and chill."
