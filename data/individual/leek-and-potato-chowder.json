        "Clean leeks by cutting off the roots and the tips of the leaves. Make a vertical cut from the root end to the tops, being careful to not cut through completely. The leeks will now open like the pages of a book, and any mud can be cleaned out between the leaves under the faucet. Slice the cleaned leeks into quarter-inch strips.",
        "Melt half the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute leeks in hot butter until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a slow cooker.",
        "Melt remaining butter in the same skillet over low heat. Gradually whisk flour into the melted butter until the mixture forms a clump of dough. Slowly stream chicken broth into the skillet, continually whisking until the broth is entirely incorporated; pour over the mixture in the slow cooker. Add bacon and potatoes to the slow cooker. Season mixture with salt and pepper; stir.",
        "Cook on Low until the potatoes are soft, stirring water into the mixture if it gets too thick, at least 2 hours. Stir half-and-half into the mixture and continue cooking for 1 hour more."
