        "Mince 1 garlic clove and in a large skillet cook in 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring, until golden. Add water and half of mussels and steam mussels, covered, stirring once or twice, 2 to 5 minutes, transferring them as they open with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. (Discard any mussels that are unopened after 5 minutes.) In liquid remaining in skillet steam remaining mussels in same manner and transfer to bowl.",
        "Pour liquid remaining in skillet through a fine sieve into a small bowl and stir in liqueur to make marinade. When mussels are cool enough to handle, remove from shells. Clean and reserve 1 half shell from each mussel. Add mussels to marinade, tossing to coat, and season with salt. Marinate mussels, covered with plastic wrap and chilled, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day. Chill reserved shells in a sealable plastic bag. Thinly slice remaining garlic clove and in a small saucepan cook in remaining 1/2 cup oil over moderate heat, stirring, until golden. Discard garlic with slotted spoon and in a blender blend oil, chervil, parsley, and salt until herbs are finely chopped. Chervil oil may be made 1 week ahead and chilled in an airtight container. Bring oil to room temperature before using.",
        "Arrange reserved mussel shells on plates and spoon about \u201a teaspoon chervil oil into each shell. Add mussels and garnish with chervil."
