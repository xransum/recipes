        "Roll out pastry with a floured rolling pin on a lightly floured surface into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle (3/4 inch thick) and trim edges. Halve pastry lengthwise with a pastry wheel or large knife to form 2 (15- by 6-inch) strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 7 equal rectangles (for a total of 14). Arrange rectangles in 1 layer on 2 large baking sheets and chill 20 minutes.",

        "Cover pastry rectangles on 1 baking sheet with an inverted large metal cooling rack to lightly weight them, then bake in upper third of oven until golden and cooked through, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove rack carefully and transfer baked pastry to another rack to cool completely. Bake remaining rectangles, weighted with rack (make sure it's cooled), in same manner.",
