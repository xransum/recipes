        "Rinse chicken inside and out and pat dry completely. Remove excess fat from chicken and prick skin all over with a fork so that seasonings can penetrate. Add chicken to marinade and rub inside and out to coat. Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. (The longer chicken marinates, the more flavor it will have.)",

        "In roasting pan arrange chicken, breast side down, and pour marinade over it. Roast chicken in middle of oven 30 minutes. Turn chicken breast side up and baste with pan juices. Roast chicken, basting occasionally, 40 minutes more, or until cooked through, skin is golden brown, and a meat thermometer inserted in fleshy part of thigh registers 180\u00b0 F. Let chicken stand, loosely covered, 10 minutes before carving. Skim fat from pan juices and transfer to sauceboat.",
