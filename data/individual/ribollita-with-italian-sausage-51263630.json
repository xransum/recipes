        "Add onion, carrots, celery, anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but still hold their shape, 20\u201325 minutes. Add kale, tomatoes, beans, and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until kale offers no resistance when bitten and flavors have melded, about 1 hour.",
        "Just before serving, add vinegar and half of croutons to soup, stirring to break them into smaller pieces. Divide remaining croutons among bowls and ladle soup over. Serve topped with Parmesan and drizzled with more oil."
