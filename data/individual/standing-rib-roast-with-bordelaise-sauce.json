        "Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F.",
        "Place the roast, fat side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Sprinkle the roast with the rosemary and thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat, away from the bone, registers 125\u00b0 to 130\u00b0F for very rare to medium-rare, about 1 hour and 10 minutes more.",
        "Transfer the roast to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.",
        "Pour off the fat from the pan and place over medium heat. Pour in the finishing sauce and cook, stirring to scrape up the browned bits, until the sauce is barely simmering, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a sauceboat. Carve the roast and arrange on a warmed platter. Pass the sauce alongside."
