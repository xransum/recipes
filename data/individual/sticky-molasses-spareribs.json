        "About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well.   Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub.  Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, make the sauce.  Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently.  Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate.",
        "Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.",
        "Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.",
        "Continue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender, spraying with apple juice every 20 to 30 minutes.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.",
        "Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.",
        "Serve ribs with remaining sauce."
