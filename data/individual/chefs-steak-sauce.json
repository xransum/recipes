        "Pour the apple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, molasses, water, and lemon juice into a large pot. Add the ginger, cayenne pepper, mustard, cloves, jalapeno, onion, peppercorns, garlic, horseradish, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally until the sauce has reduced to half its original volume, about 2 hours. Strain through a fine sieve and cool before serving."
