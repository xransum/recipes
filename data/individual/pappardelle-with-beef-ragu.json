        "Add the brisket, sauce, tomatoes and their juices to the pan. Increase the heat to high and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the flavors are blended and the sauce is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Stir in the basil and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the reserved pancetta.",
        "Cook the pasta",
        "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the salt and pasta and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the pasta is al dente, according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, add it to the sauce and toss to coat. Divide among shallow bowls and serve immediately. Pass the cheese at the table. Serves 4.",
