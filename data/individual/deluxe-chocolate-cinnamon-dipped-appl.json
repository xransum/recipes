Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir in the cinnamon. Spread the mixture thinly on wax paper into a 9 inch square, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze until hard, about 5 minutes. Remove from the freezer and crush the white chocolate into small pieces and place into a bowl.",

Carefully remove the fork and place the chocolate dipped apple slices onto a plate covered with wax paper. Refrigerate until hard, about 45 minutes."
