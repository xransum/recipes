        "Place the potatoes, carrots, and garlic into a large pot and cover with water. Season with salt, black pepper, paprika, onion powder, thyme, basil, oregano, and marjoram. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.",
