Tuck the sliced apples and onions in around the pheasants. Pour the apple jack over all and light it on fire. Shake pan until flames subside. Dust the tops of the pheasants with nutmeg.",

        "Transfer juices to a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the half-and-half and let simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt-free seasoning blend and ground black pepper. Pour over the pheasants and serve."
