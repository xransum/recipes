        "Put the eggs and vinegar in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a full boil over high heat, cover, and turn off the heat. Set aside for 15 minutes to allow the eggs to cook through. Place under cold running water to cool. Drain and peel. Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, scoop out the yolks, and transfer them to a small bowl. Set aside.",
        "Put the mustard greens in a food processor and chop finely. Add the reserved egg yolks, mayonnaise, and black pepper and process until smooth. Transfer the egg whites to a plate and fill them with the yolk mixture. Top with the roasted red peppers, capers, and jalape\u00f1o, if using. Serve immediately, or cover and chill until ready to serve or for up to 4 hours."
