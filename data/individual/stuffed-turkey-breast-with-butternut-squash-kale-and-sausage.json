        "Working one at a time, place turkey breast, skin side down, on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife and cutting parallel to board, slice through thickest part of breast, cutting along length of breast without cutting all the way through, then open breast like a book. Place breast in between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to a uniform thickness of 1/2\". Season inside of breast with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Transfer skin side up to a rimmed baking sheet; season with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Repeat with remaining breast. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, or chill up to 24 hours for maximum flavor and juiciness (if chilled, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting).",
        "Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage, stirring and breaking up into small pieces with a spoon, until browned and cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a large bowl, leaving drippings behind.",
        "Meanwhile, place croutons on a rimmed baking sheet. Crush slightly with the bottom of a small pot or pan until some pieces are smaller.",
        "Return skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 Tbsp. butter. Add onion, squash, chopped fennel, garlic, thyme, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6\u20138 minutes. Stir in kale, 2 Tbsp. butter, and 1 cup broth and cook, scraping up brown bits on bottom of pan, until kale is wilted and butter is melted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with sausage. Fold in croutons and parsley; if mixture seems dry, add 1/4 cup broth.",
        "Flip breasts so they are skin side down. Divide stuffing between breasts, spreading with a spatula and leaving a 1\" border. Starting at 1 short end, roll each breast into a log, completely enclosing stuffing, then transfer each to separate, large pieces of cheesecloth. Wrap cheesecloth around turkey and secure by tying a piece of twine at each end (like a sausage). Tie 4\u20135 pieces of twine crosswise around log, spacing about 2\u20132 1/2\" apart. Rub remaining 4 Tbsp. butter all over breasts and transfer skin side up to roasting pan.",
        "Pour enough broth (about 4 cups) to come 1/4\" up sides of turkey. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F and roast turkey, basting with pan juices every 20 minutes and adding more broth if pan starts to dry out, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 155\u00b0F, 60\u201370 minutes.",
        "Transfer to a cutting board and let sit 15\u201320 minutes (internal temperature should rise to 165\u00b0F). Remove twine and slice crosswise about 1/2\" thick to serve.",
        "Turkey can be seasoned 2 days ahead and stuffed, rolled in cheesecloth, and buttered 1 day ahead; loosely cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting."
