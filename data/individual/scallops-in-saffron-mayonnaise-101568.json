        "In a large skillet cook the scallops in 1 tablespoon of the oil, covered, over moderately high heat, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are just cooked through. Let the scallops cool in a bowl, covered loosely.",
        "In a small bowl combine the saffron with 2 teaspoons hot water. In a blender or food processor blend together the egg, the lemon, juice, the mustard, the salt, and the pepper, with the motor running add the remaining 1 cup oil in a slow stream, and blend the mayonnaise until it is emulsified. Stir in the saffron mixture and salt to taste. Dip each scallop round, patted dry, into the saffron mayonnaise, coating it well, arrange it on a lettuce leaf, and garnish each hors d'oeuvre with some of the carrot and chives. (Any remaining saffron mayonnaise may be used as a dipping sauce for vegetables.)"
