        "3. While potatoes cool, using the flat side of a knife or in a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic and salt together into a fine paste.",

Add the garlic paste, egg yolk, black pepper, olives, almonds, lemon juice, and olive oil to the potatoes and mix well, until it has the consistency of mashed potatoes.",
        "5. Adjust the consistency and taste with more olive oil, salt, and pepper, and serve."
