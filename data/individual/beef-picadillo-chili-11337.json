Add the beef, the water, the broth , the tomato pur\u00e9e, and the salt and simmer the mixture, uncovered, adding more water if necessary to keep the beef barely covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add the raisins, the olives, and the jalape\u00f1o and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until the beef is tender. Stir in the beans, simmer the chili for 5 minutes, or until the beans are heated through, and stir in the coriander. The chili may be frozen or made 4 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled."
