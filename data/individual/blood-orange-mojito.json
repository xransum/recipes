        "Fill the glasses about two-thirds full with the mixture, being sure to get a few mint leaves into each glass. Top the drinks with sparkling water, leaving a little room at the top, and gently stir. Using a reamer, squeeze an orange half over each drink. Garnish each drink with a mint sprig and serve. Makes 4 drinks.",
