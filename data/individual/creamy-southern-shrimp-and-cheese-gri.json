Stir farmers cheese, goat cheese, and American cheese into grits until cheese has melted. Set grits aside and keep warm.",
        "Melt butter with vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir tomato, 2 green onions, and garlic in the hot skillet until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
