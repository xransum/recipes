        "In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic for 10 to 15 minutes, or until onion is caramelized. Reduce heat to low and pour in about 1 cup of bourbon to deglaze the pan. Return saucepan to medium high heat, add the remaining bourbon, and bring to a slow boil for 5 to 10 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook out of the bourbon.",
