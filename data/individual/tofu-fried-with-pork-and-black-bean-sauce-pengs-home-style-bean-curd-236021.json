        "Stir together pork, wine, and salt in a small bowl.",
        "Cut tofu lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice crosswise into thirds. Blot tofu pieces between layers of paper towels to absorb excess moisture. Repeat with 1 or 2 changes of dry paper towels.",
        "Heat 1 cup peanut oil in wok over high heat until thermometer registers 375\u00b0F. Cook tofu in 5 or 6 batches, stirring to keep slices from sticking together and turning over as needed, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Transfer tofu as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 375\u00b0F between batches. Carefully transfer oil to a heatproof container to cool (before discarding), then wipe wok clean.",
        "Reheat wok over high heat until smoking, then add remaining 3 tablespoons peanut oil, swirling to coat wok evenly. Add chiles and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add pork mixture and stir-fry until no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes, then add black beans and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add stock, tofu, and soy sauce and simmer 3 minutes.",
        "Stir together potato starch and water in a small bowl, then add to tofu mixture in wok and simmer, stirring until sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Add scallion greens, stirring until just wilted, then remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Stir in chile oil to taste."
