        "Cut 2 or 3 thin slices from tip of jalape\u00f1o (wear rubber gloves) and reserve for garnish. In a saucepan simmer tomatillos and remaining jalape\u00f1o in water to cover until tomatillos are tender, about 5 minutes, and transfer tomatillos, jalape\u00f1o, and 1/4 cup cooking liquid to a blender or food processor. Blend salsa until chopped but not completely smooth and transfer to a serving bowl. Cool salsa and chill, covered, until cold. Salsa may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.",
