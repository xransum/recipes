        "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan.",
        "In a mixing bowl, cream margarine and granulated sugar until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Dissolve baking soda in buttermilk and add to the creamed mixture.",
        "Place flour in a large bowl and add dates, orange slices, and nuts.  Stir to coat each piece.  Add flour mixture and coconut to creamed mixture.  This makes a very stiff dough, so it will be necessary to stir with a wooden spoon.",
        "Pour batter into the tube pan.  Bake for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  As soon as cake comes from oven, combine the orange juice and confectioners sugar and pour over hot cake.  Let stand in pan overnight."
