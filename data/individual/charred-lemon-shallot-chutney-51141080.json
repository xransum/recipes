        "Broil lemon-shallot mixture until beginning to char in spots, 8-10 minutes. Turn lemon rounds and shallot slices over and broil until almost completely charred, 6 minutes, watching closely (once they begin to char, they can darken very quickly; discard any burnt lemon or shallot). Let cool.",
