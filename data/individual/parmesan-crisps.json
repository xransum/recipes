        "Grate the Parmesan using the large grating side of a box grater, as you might use to grate carrots. Combine the Parmesan, flour, thyme, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. With a measuring spoon, spoon level tablespoons of the mixture onto the prepared sheet pans, spreading each round into a 3-inch disk. Toss the mixture each time and scoop from the bottom of the bowl to be sure you get some flour in each spoonful. Bake in the middle of the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.",
