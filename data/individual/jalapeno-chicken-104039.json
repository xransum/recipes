        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Starting at neck end, carefully run fingers between skin and breast meat of chicken, loosening skin. Place chili rounds, spaced slightly apart, on breast meat under skin. Toss 4 lemon wedges, onion, 1/2 tablespoon oil and soy sauce in small bowl to coat. Stuff lemon mixture into main cavity of chicken. Rub outside of chicken with remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with salt. Place chicken on rack in roasting pan. Roast chicken until golden brown and juices run clear when thigh is pierced with knife, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer chicken to platter. Serve with remaining lemon wedges."
