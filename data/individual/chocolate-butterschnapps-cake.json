        "In a large bowl, beat eggs well.  Gradually add sugar, and beat until fluffy.  Add cooled chocolate mixture slowly; mix well.  Stir in 1/4 cup schnapps, almond extract, and vanilla.  Briefly stir together flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually add flour mixture to chocolate mixture.  Mix only to combine.  Stir in chips with spatula.  Divide batter into two greased and floured, 8 inch, round cake pans.",
        "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cake tests done.  Cool for 10 minutes in the pans.",

        "Remove layers from pans.  Brush with remaining schnapps.  Place one layer on a serving plate. Pour 1/3 of the glaze over the layer, and then place the second layer over the first.  Pour remaining glaze over the whole cake.   Decorate with slivered almonds."
