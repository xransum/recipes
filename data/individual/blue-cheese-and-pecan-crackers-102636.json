        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Using electric mixer, beat cheese, butter and pepper in medium bowl until just blended (some cheese should still be in separate pieces). Using rubber spatula, mix in flour, then chopped pecans. Form dough into 1-inch balls. Arrange rounds on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten to 2 1/2-inch rounds. Press pecan half onto each. Bake until golden on bottom and at edges, about 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool."
