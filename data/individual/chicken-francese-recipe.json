        "Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat until warmed. Add the oil. During heating, dip the chicken breasts into the eggs, and then dust each breast with seasoned flour on both sides. Once floured, add to the oiled pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook until light brown in color, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and repeat cooking for a final 3 to 4 minutes. Once cooked, remove the breasts from the pan and allow to finish with carry-over cooking.",
        "Return the same pan to the heat and add the stock. Allow to simmer and reduce by three-quarters of the volume. After reducing, whisk in the butter to create a sauce, removing from the heat during the process. Finally, finish with lemon juice and parsley and serve over the chicken."
