        "Heat 3 tablespoons oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and saut\u00e9 until brown, about 8 minutes. Add carrot, celery, and garlic; saut\u00e9 until vegetables begin to color, about 5 minutes. Add lentils, jalape\u00f1os, and paprika; stir to coat. Add broth and vinegar and bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until lentils are almost tender, about 1 hour. Uncover and cook until all broth is absorbed, about 25 minutes longer.

Top with second wrapper, egg white side down, and seal, pressing out any air. Cut into round with fluted pastry wheel or 2 3/4-inch-diameter scalloped cookie cutter, if desired. Place on prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate.)",

        "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sausages. Saut\u00e9 until golden, about 4 minutes per side. Place on baking sheet; keep warm in oven.",
        "Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Cook 1/3 of ravioli until just tender but still firm to bite, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, divide ravioli between 2 shallow bowls; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining ravioli in 2 more batches. Rewarm sauce; spoon around ravioli. Top with sausage."
