        "Fry bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Transfer to paper towels and drain. Season chicken with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Add onions to skillet and saut\u00e9 until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Add broth, wine, prunes, gravy and thyme. Cover skillet and simmer until onions are just tender, about 6 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to high and boil until sauce coats spoon, about 10 minutes. Return chicken and any juices to skillet. Simmer until chicken is heated through, about 2 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat gently before serving.) Arrange chicken on platter. Spoon sauce over. Crumble bacon over top of chicken and serve."
