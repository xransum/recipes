        "Cook drumsticks on preheated grill, basting frequently with heated marinade and turning 1/4 turn every 12 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 48 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
