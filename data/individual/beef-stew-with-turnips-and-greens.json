        "In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onions and bacon and saut\u00e9 until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Working in batches, add the beef to the pot in a single layer and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Return all the meat to the pot, sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until the meat is evenly coated, about 1 minute. Return the onions and bacon to the pot, and add the garlic and bouquet garni.",
        "Increase the heat to high, pour in the wine and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the broth and tomato paste, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
        "Remove the bouquet garni and discard. Add the turnips, cover and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Add the turnip greens, cover and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the stew into warmed bowls and serve immediately. Serves 6.",
