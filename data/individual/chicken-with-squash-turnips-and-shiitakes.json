        "In a large, heavy fry pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.",
        "Add the chicken to the pan and cook, turning once, until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the squash and turnips and stir to coat with the olive oil. Add the 1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Chop half of the turnip greens, reserving the remainder for another use. Add the mushrooms and chopped turnip greens to the pan with the chicken. Cover and simmer until the greens wilt, about 5 minutes.",
        "Put the flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the 1 Tbs. broth until smooth. Add to the pan, stirring, then cover and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Adjust the seasoning and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
