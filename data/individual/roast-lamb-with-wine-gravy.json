        "Combine the breadcrumbs, green onions, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl. Sprinkle into the roasting dish over the meat drippings, then return the dish to the oven, and continue baking until the breadcrumbs have toasted to a golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.",
        "Remove the baking dish from the oven; set the lamb leg onto a plate, and cover with aluminum foil. Allow the lamb to rest in a warm spot for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the baking dish onto a burner on the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in the wine and beef stock, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 5 minutes. Slice the lamb leg, and serve with the wine gravy."
