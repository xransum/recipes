Remove the crumb mixture from the food processor and press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of the prepared tartlet pans.",
        "Bake until the crusts are set and begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let cool.",
        "Remove the cooled tartlet shells from the pans and gently spoon the curd into the shells. Arrange the kiwifruit slices on top, garnish with the lemon zest and serve. Makes 4 tartlets.",
