        "Stir cilantro, parsley, and mint together in a small saucepan. Remove half of the herb mixture, and set aside. Stir the garlic, lemon, olives, olive oil, and black pepper into the remaining herbs. Spread 2 tablespoons of this mixture onto the lamb rack. Wrap the exposed bones with aluminum foil to keep them from burning. Stir the olives and bell pepper into the reserved mixture and keep warm over low heat.",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.",
        "Cook the lamb rack on the preheated grill until cooked to desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Baste occasionally with the warmed relish. Once cooked, remove from grill, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into individual chops.",
        "To serve, arrange lamb chops on a platter, spoon some of the warmed relish over them, and sprinkle with the reserved chopped herbs."
