        "Combine 2 cups bread flour, water, yeast, and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer fitted with dough attachment. Mix on lowest speed until blended but still moist, about 2 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.",
        "Uncover bowl and mix the dough with electric mixer on low speed until dough has pulled together, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in remaining flour until soft, sticky dough forms, 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Increase mixer speed to medium and mix until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rest, about 20 minutes. Rub a few drops of olive oil evenly into a plastic container.",
        "Transfer dough onto a floured work surface. Dust hands with flour and knead dough until soft but still wet on the inside. Form into a ball and place into prepared container. Refrigerate dough at least 1 day and up to 7 days."
