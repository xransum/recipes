Stir; spread potatoes in a single layer again and brown. Repeat until potatoes are golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add butter and chopped green onions; cook and stir until onions have sweetened and softened up a bit, 3 to 4 minutes. Add reserved pancetta. Stir in chopped kale and cook until kale wilts. Add grated cheese; cook and stir briefly.",
