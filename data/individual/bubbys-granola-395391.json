        "3. Combine the rolled oats, pecans, walnuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl.",
        "4. Pour the honey mixture over the oat mixture and toss briskly to combine. Be sure all the oats, nuts, and seeds are thoroughly coated.",
        "5. Spread out the granola evenly on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, until golden (not dark) brown. Be careful not to overbake it.",
        "6. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the granola to cool completely. It will be crispy when it cools. Transfer the granola to a large container with a lid. Store, tightly covered, at room temperature. Just before serving, add the raisins."
