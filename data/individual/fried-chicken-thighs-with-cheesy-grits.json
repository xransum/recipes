        "Combine buttermilk, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, and paprika in a large bowl or large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, cover bowl or seal bag, and toss to coat. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.",
        "Bring 4 cups salted water to a boil and gradually add grits, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking occasionally, until grits are very tender and creamy, 25\u201330 minutes. Add cream cheese and Parmesan; whisk until melted and incorporated; season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.",
        "Whisk flour, cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, and 2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl.",
        "Remove chicken thighs from brine, letting excess drip off. Working in batches, dredge chicken in flour mixture, occasionally dipping your fingers in brine as you pack on flour to help create moistened, shaggy bits (the makings of a super-crisp crust); transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.",
        "Fit a large cast-iron skillet with thermometer and heat oil until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Working in batches and returning oil to 350\u00b0F between batches, fry chicken thighs, turning occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and coating is deep golden brown and crisp, 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet and let sit while you cook the kale.",
        "Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high. Add kale in large handfuls, letting it cook down slightly before adding more and tossing to coat. Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until wilted and bright green, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar and 1 Tbsp. pepper jelly and toss to coat.",
        "Divide grits evenly among bowls and top with kale, fried chicken, and more pepper jelly."
