        "In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the chocolate with the cream, stirring, remove the bowl from the pan, and let the mixture cool while making the meringue. In another metal bowl combine the whites and the sugar, set the bowl over a saucepan of hot but not simmering water, and stir the mixture until the sugar is dissolved. With a hand-held electric mixer beat the meringue for 5 minutes, or until it holds glossy stiff peaks and is warm to the touch. Remove the bowl from the pan and continue beating the meringue until it is cool. Transfer 1 cup of the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a small decorative tip, fold the remaining meringue into the chocolate mixture gently but thoroughly, and divide the mousse among 6 small dishes. The mousse may be made 4 hours in advance and kept covered at room temperature or it may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and allowed to come to room temperature.",
        "On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil pipe the remaining meringue into 2-inch strips and bake the strips in the middle of a preheated 300\u00b0F. oven for 15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden. Let the meringues cool on the baking sheet and peel them from the paper. The meringues may be made 2 days in advance and kept in an airtight container. Serve the meringues and fruit for dipping into the mousse fondues."
