        "Heat oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Stir in the cloves, whole black peppercorn, cinnamon, cardamom and bay leaf. Cover the pan as the pepper tends to splutter right out of the pan and can cause burns! Let heat for 1 minute.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the sliced onions. Saute until the onions are soft and almost translucent. Mix in the  tomatoes and saute well. (For a great taste, saute until almost dry.)",
        "Raise the stovetop's temperature to a medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in  the chili powder,  red kidney beans and salt; mix well. Slowly add water a small amount at a time. You are adding water to create a gravy, only add water until the gravy has reached the consistency that you would like. For a smoother gravy, cool and blend the sauteed mixture before adding the red kidney beans. Garnish with cilantro."
