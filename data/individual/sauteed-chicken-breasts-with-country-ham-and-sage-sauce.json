        "Preheat the oven to 200\u00baF. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderately hight heat until the foam subsides. White the fat is heating, pat 4 of the chicken breast halves dry, season one side of each breast with the pepper and salt to taste and, in the fat, brown the 4 breasts, seasoned sides down, for 1 minute.
