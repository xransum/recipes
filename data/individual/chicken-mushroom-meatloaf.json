        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.",
        "Mix together the bran cereal and buttermilk in a bowl, and set aside to soften. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated. Stir in rosemary, thyme, and ketchup; season with salt and black pepper.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the chicken breast and thigh meat, eggs, and bread crumbs until thoroughly combined, then lightly mix in the parsley, buttermilk-cereal mixture, and mushroom mixture. Pat the mixture into the prepared loaf pan.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until browned, the loaf is no longer pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow to rest for about 10 minutes before serving."
