        "In a heavy, nonstick fry pan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar and water. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture thickens slightly, about 20 seconds. Add the walnuts and saut\u00e9 until the nuts are lightly toasted and coated with the sugar mixture, about 4 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a piece of parchment paper and sprinkle with salt. Using a fork, separate the nuts and let cool completely.",
        "Preheat an oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Brush a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.",
        "Place the squash in a bowl, drizzle with 1 Tbs. of the olive oil, sprinkle with 1 tsp. of the curry powder and toss to coat evenly. Spread the squash cubes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Roast, stirring once, until tender and golden brown, 23 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the shallot, vinegar, the remaining 1/2 tsp. curry powder and the remaining 3 Tbs. olive oil.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the salad greens, squash and pear. Add about two-thirds of the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Taste and add more vinaigrette if needed. Top the salad with the goat cheese and walnuts and serve immediately. Serves 2 to 4.",
