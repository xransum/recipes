        "Place the beef in a bowl, sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce, and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in the onion, 1/2 the green bell pepper, 1/2 the red bell pepper, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender.",
        "Transfer beef to the skillet, and cook until evenly brown. Mix in the mushrooms. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and cornstarch as needed to thicken the sauce. Mix in the remaining green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Remove from heat, and transfer to a large bowl (not the one used to season the beef). Mix cooked rice into the bowl with the beef. Serve garnished with parsley."
