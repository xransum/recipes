        "Tear the mustard green and chard leaves from the tough center stalks, discarding the stalks.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the sugar (this helps retain the bright color of the greens). Add the mustard greens to the boiling water and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove and drain the mustard green leaves, pressing on the greens to extract all the liquid. Cook and drain the chard in the same manner, cooking it for 2 minutes; cook and drain the spinach, cooking it as you did the mustard greens, for 1 minute. Transfer the wilted and drained greens to a cutting board or food processor and chop or pulse until finely chopped; set aside.",
        "In a large saut\u00e9 pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cumin and saut\u00e9 until the onion is translucent and beginning to brown, 8 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and chile, and saut\u00e9 until aromatic, about 45 seconds. Stir in the greens, cream and garam masala and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until the flavors have melded, 10 minutes.",
        "Gently fold the paneer into the greens and simmer until heated through, 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
