        "Cut off the ends of the plantains and slice a slit into the skin on two sides. Cut the plantains into 1 inch pieces, soak them in ice water for 10 minutes. Remove from the water and use a sharp knife to peel the skin away. Place the plantain pieces in a pot with 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and mash the plantains in a potato ricer or with a potato masher. Add a bit of cooking liquid to loosen, then add the butter, garlic, and scallions. Season with salt and pepper and hold, keeping warm, until ready to use.",
