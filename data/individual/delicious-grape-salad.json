        "Beat the sour cream, cream cheese, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer on Low speed until smooth. Spread enough graham cracker crumbs to cover the bottom into a glass serving bowl, and top with about 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture in a layer. Spread green grapes, then red grapes over the cheese filling. Save a few green and red grapes for a garnish. Repeat the layers several more times, ending with a layer of cream cheese filling. Garnish the top of the salad with sprinkled brown sugar and the reserved grapes.",
        "Cover the salad with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly cold, 30 minutes to 1 hour."
