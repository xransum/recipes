        "Heat olive oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chopped parsley and chopped garlic and saut\u00e9 until garlic just begins to color, about 45 seconds. Add reserved clam juices, whipping cream, dry white wine, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, white pepper and cayenne pepper. Simmer until mixture is reduced to thin sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Add chopped clams and freshly cooked linguine to pot and toss until sauce coats pasta thickly, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing Parmesan, if desired."
