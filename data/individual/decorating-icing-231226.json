        "Whisk together confectioners sugar and powdered whites in a large bowl. Add water, juice, and vanilla and beat with an electric mixer (preferably fitted with whisk attachment if using a stand mixer) at low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and continue to beat icing, scraping down side of bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula, until it holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 with a handheld.",
        "If not piping icing immediately, cover surface with a dampened paper towel, then cover bowl with plastic wrap."
