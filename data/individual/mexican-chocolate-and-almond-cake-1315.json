        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line bottom of 8-inch square baking pan with parchment. Finely grind almonds, chocolate, orange peel and cinnamon in processor. In medium bowl of electric mixer, beat yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar until light yellow and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Mix in nut mixture (mixture will be very thick). Using clean dry bowl and beater, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Mix half of whites into chocolate mixture to lighten. Gently fold in remaining whites.",
