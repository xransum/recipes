        "In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the molasses. Into the bowl sift together the flour, the baking soda, the salt, and the spices, beat the dough until it is combined well, and stir in the currants. Halve the dough and on a sheet of wax paper form each half into an 8-inch log, using the wax paper as a guide. Chill the logs, wrapped in the wax paper, for at least 4 hours or overnight.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut the logs into 1/4-inch-thick slices with a sharp knife and arrange the slices 2 inches apart on lightly buttered baking sheets. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool."
