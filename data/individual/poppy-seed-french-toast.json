        "Dip one slice of the bread into the egg batter, then quickly take it out. Continue dipping bread slices, stirring the batter frequently so all the poppy seeds don't sink to the bottom, and laying the bread on the frying pan until no more bread will fit.",
        "Cook the slices for about 2 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown. Repeat with remaining bread. Serve hot."
