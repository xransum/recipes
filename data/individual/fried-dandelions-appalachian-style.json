        "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove half of the dandelions from the egg, and allow the excess egg to drip away. Toss in the flour until completely coated, then remove from the flour, tossing between your hands to allow excess flour to fall away. Cook the dandelions in the melted butter until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining dandelions."
