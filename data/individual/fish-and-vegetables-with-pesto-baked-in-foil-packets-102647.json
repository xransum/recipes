        "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Blend pesto, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce in small bowl. Arrange four 12x12-inch pieces of heavy-duty foil on work surface. Place 1 fish fillet in center of each. Sprinkle fish lightly with salt and pepper. Spread each fillet with 1 tablespoon pesto mixture. Top each fillet with asparagus, tomatoes and squash, then dollop with remaining pesto mixture. Fold sides of foil over fish and vegetables, covering completely; seal packets closed.",
        "Using long spatula, transfer foil packets to large baking sheet. Bake until fish is just opaque in center and vegetables are crisp-tender, about 25 minutes."
