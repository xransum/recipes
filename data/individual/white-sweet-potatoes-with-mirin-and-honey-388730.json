        "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Place a well-seasoned 8\"-10\" cast-iron skillet in oven.",
        "Pierce potatoes in several spots with a fork. Microwave sweet potatoes on high for 5 minutes. (Alternatively, wrap sweet potatoes in foil and bake at 450\u00b0F until tender around edges but still hard in center, 30-35 minutes.) Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes.",
        "Whisk mirin, honey, vinegar, and salt in a medium bowl. Peel sweet potatoes and cut crosswise into 1\"-1 1/2\"-thick rounds. Add to mirin mixture; toss to coat.",
        "Using oven mitts, carefully remove heated skillet from oven; add oil and swirl pan to coat. Add sweet potatoes and mirin mixture to skillet, arranging potatoes cut side down. Bake until sweet potatoes are caramelized on one side, 15-20 minutes. Turn sweet potatoes, rotating them around pan to avoid hot spots, and cook until tender and caramelized, 5-7 minutes longer.",
        "Transfer sweet potatoes to a platter. Add 2 tablespoons water to skillet, scraping up browned bits. Add butter, swirling pan to melt and combine. Pour sauce over sweet potatoes. Season with salt."
