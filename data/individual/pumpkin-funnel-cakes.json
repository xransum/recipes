Release your finger, and drizzle the batter into the hot oil using a circular motion to make 4 to 6 inch circle, and then cross over the circle to make a spiral pattern. Cook until golden brown. Turn the cake over to cook the bottom side. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the oil, and drain on paper towels. Cool 5 minutes, and dust generously with confectioners' sugar."
