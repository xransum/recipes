When potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove skins and discard. In a food processor blend potatoes with vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon until smooth. Transfer potatoes to a bowl and stir in sour cream until combined well. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Sweet potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
