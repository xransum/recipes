        "In a soup pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the leeks and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the fennel and potatoes and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 10 minutes.",
        "Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cover partially and cook until the vegetables are completely softened, about 20 minutes. Add the watercress and cook until it is wilted but is still bright green, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
        "In a blender, food mill or food processor, puree the soup in batches until smooth and return the soup to the pot. Alternatively, process with a stick blender in the pot until smooth. Stir in the cream. Season with salt and white pepper, adding a bit of extra salt; flavors are less pronounced when a dish is served cold, so more salt is needed to bring out the taste of the food. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.",
        "Ladle the soup into chilled bowls and garnish with fennel leaves."
