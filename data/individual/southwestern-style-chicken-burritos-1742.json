Add peppers, onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 until tender, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm in oven.",
        "Remove chicken from marinade and grill until golden brown and almost cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Layer 1/4 cup cheese, 1 chili, then another 1/4 cup cheese onto each breast half. Grill until chicken is cooked through and cheese melts, about 3 minutes.",
