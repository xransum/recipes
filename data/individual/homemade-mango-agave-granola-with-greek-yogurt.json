        "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 1/2-sheet pan with parchment paper or silpat. Mix together the oil, agave syrup, honey, cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl until smooth. Combine the oats, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, wheat germ, flax seed, and salt in a large bowl. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and stir well to combine making sure everything is evenly coated. Spread the mixture evenly onto the prepared sheet pan and bake in the oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. While still warm, break into clumps. Add the dried fruit after it has cooled. Serve the yogurt in bowls and top with some of the granola and a drizzle of honey. Store the leftover granola in an airtight container in a cool place."
