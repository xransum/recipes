        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch tube pan. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the apples, 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Stir so that the apples are coated.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the 2 cups of sugar, oil and eggs. Mix well. Combine the flour, and baking powder and add to the sugar mixture. Mix until blended. Then stir in the vanilla and orange juice. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan, top with half of the sliced apples. Pour the other half of the batter over the apples and then top with the remaining apples. Also, pour any juice from the apples onto the cake.",
        "Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cover the cake with aluminum foil for the last 15 minutes so that the top will not burn."
