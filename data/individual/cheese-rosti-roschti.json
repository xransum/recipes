        "Place potatoes in large pot with chicken broth and add enough water to cover potatoes completely; bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes, transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, 8 hours to overnight.",
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).",
        "Grate potatoes, discarding any lumps or skin that don't pass through the grater.",
        "Heat olive oil and butter in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in hot oil mixture until soft but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes into skillet. Season potato mixture with salt and black pepper; stir gently and shape into a large potato cake in the skillet.",
        "Cook the potato cake in the skillet until base of cake is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Place a plate on top of the skillet, turn the skillet upside-down to remove the cake from the pan, and slide cake, browned-side up, back into skillet. Cook until the other side of the cake is browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Sprinkle Swiss cheese over the top of the cake.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and starts to brown, 10 to 20 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 10 minutes before slicing."
