        "In a small fry pan over medium-low heat, toast the almonds, stirring, until fragrant and lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour onto a plate to cool.",
        "In a small bowl, stir together the orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, sugar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add the olive oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly until the vinaigrette is well combined.",
        "Using a mandoline or a very sharp knife, shave the rhubarb into paper-thin slices. Put it in a bowl with the mesclun and almonds. Add half of the vinaigrette and toss to combine. Add more vinaigrette as needed to lightly coat the lettuces (you may not need it all). Crumble the cheese over the top and serve immediately. Serves 6.",
