        "Assemble by spreading half of the hummus over the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish. Tear the pita bread rounds into pieces and layer these over the hummus. Spoon the remaining hummus evenly over the bread, then top with pine nuts. Sprinkle with paprika, half the parsley, and drizzle with lemon juice. If adding a meat layer, top the casserole with ground beef mixture and remaining parsley, and serve."
