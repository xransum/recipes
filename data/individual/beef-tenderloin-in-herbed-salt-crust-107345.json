        "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
        "Pat beef dry. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown beef (excluding ends), turning occasionally, about 6 minutes total. Transfer beef to a shallow roasting pan, reserving pan drippings in skillet.",
        "Stir together salt, rosemary, pepper, and water until mixture resembles wet sand. Pat salt mixture onto top and sides of meat to coat evenly and roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into meat registers 130\u00b0F for medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes.",
        "Let meat stand in roasting pan 5 minutes. Remove salt crust and transfer meat to a cutting board. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices and spoon meat juices from skillet over slices."
