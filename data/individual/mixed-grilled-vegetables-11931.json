        "Brush the vegetables lightly with the oil, grill them in batches on a rack set 4 inches over glowing coals, turning them, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are tender, transferring them to a platter as they are done. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and keep them warm, covered with foil. (Alternatively, the vegetables may be roasted in batches on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat, turning them, for 10 to 15 minutes, transferring them to a jelly-roll pan set on the bottom rack of the oven as they are done.)"
