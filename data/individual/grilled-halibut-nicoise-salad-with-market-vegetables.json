        "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Rub halibut with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill, skin side down, until skin is charred and fish is nearly cooked through, 5\u20138 minutes. Turn and grill just until cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer halibut to a plate and remove skin.",
        "Toss vegetables with remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and tender. Time will be different for each vegetable (about 2 minutes for scallions and garlic scapes, 4 minutes for Romano beans, 8\u201310 minutes for eggplants, 10\u201315 for potatoes). Transfer to a plate as they are done.",
        "Carefully peel and halve eggs (yolks will still be a bit loose in the center). Arrange lettuce leaves on a platter and place halibut, grilled vegetables, tomatoes, radishes, and eggs in separate areas on top. Spoon some Green Olive Tapenade over; serve remaining tapenade alongside."
