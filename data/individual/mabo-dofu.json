Stir in the pork, breaking it up as you stir, and cook and stir until the pork is browned and broken into small pieces. Add the chili bean sauce, soy sauce, sake, and oyster sauce, stir to mix the ingredients together, reduce heat, and let simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, about 3 more minutes.",
