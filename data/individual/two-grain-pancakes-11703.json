        "In a bowl whisk together the cornmeal, the flours, the baking powder, the sugar, and the salt, add the egg, the milk, and the butter, and whisk the batter until it is blended well. Heat a griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with oil. Working in batches, drop the batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, cook the pancakes for 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer them as they are cooked to a platter. Serve the pancakes with the syrup."
