Add 2/3 cup milk and mix, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls to reach desired consistency. Season potatoes to taste with salt and pepper.",

Saut\u00e9 until juices evaporate and mushrooms brown, about 12 minutes; season with salt and pepper. (Potatoes and mushrooms can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand separately at room temperature. Rewarm separately over medium heat before continuing.)",
