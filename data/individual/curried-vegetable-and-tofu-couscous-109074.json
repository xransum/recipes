        "Heat olive oil in very large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add tofu in single layer and cook without stirring until just golden, about 4 minutes. Turn tofu over and cook 2 minutes longer. Transfer tofu to couscous. Add broccoli, onion, and bell pepper to skillet; cook over medium-high heat 2 minutes without stirring. Continue to cook vegetables until crisp-tender, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water; increase heat to high and bring to boil, stirring to scrape up browned bits. Mix in 1/2 cup cilantro. Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper. Mix couscous, vegetables, and cooking liquid in large serving bowl. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro and serve."
