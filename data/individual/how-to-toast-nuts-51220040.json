        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Arrange the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place in the middle rack of the oven and toast for 10 to 15 minutes, until nuts turn golden brown. Stir a few times during toasting so the nuts in the middle toast as quickly as the ones at the edges of the pan.",
        "Saut\u00e9 the nuts in a skillet over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the nuts start to turn golden brown. Transfer to a plate and cool."
