        "In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shallots and garlic and saut\u00e9 until the shallots are wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the cremini, thyme, the 1/4 tsp. salt and the 1/4 tsp. pepper. Cook until the cremini release their liquid and begin to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the reserved mushroom soaking liquid and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom.",
