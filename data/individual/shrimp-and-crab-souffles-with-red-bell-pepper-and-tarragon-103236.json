        "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Butter one 10-cup souffl\u00e9 dish or six 1 1/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to coat. (If using 1 1/4-cup dishes, place all 6 on rimmed baking sheet.) Combine crab, shrimp, roasted peppers and tarragon in processor; chop finely, using on/off turns.",
        "Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, shallot and cayenne. Cook without browning until mixture begins to bubble, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, then wine. Cook until smooth, thick and beginning to boil, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix yolks and salt in bowl. Add yolk mixture all at once to sauce; whisk in quickly. Stir in crab mixture. Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm souffl\u00e9 base to lighten. Fold in 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, then remaining whites. Transfer souffl\u00e9 mixture to prepared dish.",
        "Place souffl\u00e9 in oven. Bake souffl\u00e9 until puffed, golden and gently set in center, about 40 minutes for large souffl\u00e9 (or 25 minutes for small souffl\u00e9s). Using oven mitts, transfer souffl\u00e9 to platter and serve immediately."
