        "Whisk 3 eggs and 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped rosemary in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in half of leek mixture. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture to skillet and swirl with rubber spatula. Cook until bottom of mixture is light brown and eggs are set on top, lifting sides of omelet to let uncooked egg flow under, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Arrange half of sausage, mushrooms, peppers and cheese on 1/3 of omelet. Fold one side of omelet over filling and roll out onto heated plate. Garnish with rosemary sprig. Repeat with remaining mushrooms, peppers and cheese, forming second omelet."
