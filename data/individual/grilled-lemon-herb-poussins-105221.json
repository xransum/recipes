        "Prepare a charcoal grill (with lid) or preheat a gas grill on medium heat.",
        "Stir together softened butter, zest, chopped thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper with a fork.",
        "Rinse poussins and pat dry. Season cavities with salt and pepper. Working from cavity end of each bird, run your fingers between skin and flesh of breasts and legs to loosen skin without tearing. Push lemon butter under skin and massage skin from outside to spread butter evenly over breasts and onto legs.",
        "Insert a thyme sprig and 2 lemon wedges into cavity of each poussin, then tie legs together with kitchen string. Brush birds with melted butter and season with salt and pepper.",
        "When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 3 to 4 seconds), place birds, breast sides up, on grill rack and cover grill. Roast, turning every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in fleshy part of a thigh registers 170\u00b0F, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer birds to a platter and discard string, then let stand 10 minutes."
