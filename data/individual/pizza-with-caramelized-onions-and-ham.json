        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough into a 10-inch (25-cm) round. Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Transfer the dough to a floured pizza peel. Top with half each of the cheese, caramelized onions and ham.",

        "Using the pizza peel, transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Preheat the pizza maker again, assemble the remaining pizza and bake on the classic setting. Cut into slices and serve immediately. Makes two 10-inch (25-cm) pizzas."
