        "In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Working in batches, brown the chicken on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium. Add the leeks and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom, until the liquid is almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add 1 Tbs. of the tarragon, 2 Tbs. of the parsley, the lemon juice, broth, carrots and chicken.",
        "Transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base. Cover and cook on high according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the chicken and carrots are tender, about 3 hours; stir in the cream during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Stir in the remaining 1 Tbs. tarragon and 1 Tbs. parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with mashed potatoes alongside. Serves 4 to 6."
