        "Fold a 48 by 18 inch piece of heavy foil in half to make a 24 by 18 inch rectangle.  Grease the foil with about 1 Tbsp of Melt(R) Organic Buttery Spread",
        "Place the potatoes in the center of the foil. Sprinkle with all of the herbs, cheese, and spices. Top with bacon if using. Dot with the remaining 2 Tbsp Melt.  Bring up two opposite edges of the foil and seal with double fold.  Fold remaining ends to completely enclose the potatoes, leaving room for steam to build.",
        "For a gas grill, preheat the grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place foil packet on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill for 30 to 40 minutes or until potatoes are tender, turning packet every 10 minutes.  For a charcoal grill, place packet over medium coals for the same amount of time."
