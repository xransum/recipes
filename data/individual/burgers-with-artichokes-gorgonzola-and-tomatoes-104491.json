        "Preheat broiler. Mix meat, onion, seasoning blend, salt and pepper in large bowl. Divide mixture into 6 portions; shape each into 3x5-inch rectangular patty (about same size as roll).",
        "Broil cut sides of rolls until beginning to turn golden brown, about 1 minute; transfer roll bottoms to plates. Broil pork patties until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side (or broil lamb patties until cooked to medium doneness, about 4 minutes per side). Top each burger with artichoke mixture. Broil until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute. Place 1 burger with topping on each roll bottom. Place tomato slices, then fresh basil and roll tops on burgers."
