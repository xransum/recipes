        "Bobby's Perfect Patty",
        "Shape 6 ounces of 80 percent lean ground beef chuck into a uniform patty, no more than 3/4 inch thick (don't overwork the meat). Make a depression in the center with your thumb so the burger won't bulge; the indent will rise as the patty cooks. Preheat a grill or cast-iron grill pan to high. Brush the burger with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred, turning once (7 minutes for medium-rare). Avoid pressing with a spatula! Add cheese for the last minute of cooking.",
        "Cheese",
        "Your pick: Monterey Jack is a California favorite, but Bobby loves this burger with cheddar, too.",
        "Avocado Relish",
        "Avocado is one of Bobby's favorite ingredients. He mixes 2 chopped Hass avocados with 1/2 diced small onion, 1 minced jalapeno, the juice of 1 lime, 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, and salt and pepper.",
        "Watercress",
        "L.A. doesn't do iceberg lettuce, so Bobby tops off the burger with this peppery green instead.",
        "Tomato",
        "One thick, juicy slice takes the place of ketchup.",
