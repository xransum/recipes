        "Blend together flour, butter, shortening, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips (or pulse in a food processor) until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle evenly with 5 tablespoons ice water and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.",
        "Squeeze a small handful: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until just combined. (Do not overwork mixture, or pastry will be tough.)",
        "Turn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 6 portions. With the heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all of dough together with scraper and press into 2 balls, then flatten each into a 5\" disk. Chill dough, each disk wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.",
        "Toss nectarines, plums, raspberries, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of sugar in a large bowl.",
        "Grind tapioca to a powder in grinder, then whisk together with cornstarch, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a small bowl (do not toss with fruit until dough is rolled out).",
        "Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, into a 13\"-14\" round, then fit into a 9\" pie plate and trim edge, leaving a 1\" overhang.",
        "Roll out remaining disk to a 14\" round. Slide round onto a baking sheet. Cover and chill both crusts for 1 hour.",
        "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0 with rack in lower third. Toss sugar mixture with fruit and transfer to chilled pie shell.",
        "Using fluted pastry wheel (or other utensil), cut chilled dough round into 3/4\"-wide strips. Weave strips over filling, forming a lattice. Trim strips 1/2\" shorter than dough overhang. Fold overhang over strips and crimp edges decoratively.",
        "Brush beaten egg over crust edges and lattice. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over crust. Set pie on a large rimmed baking sheet lined with foil.",
        "Bake pie 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0 and continue to bake, checking frequently and covering edge with a strip of foil or pie shield if crusts are browning too fast, until crusts are golden brown and filling is bubbling, 40-50 minutes more.",
        "Cool pie to room temperature on a rack, at least 2 hours."
