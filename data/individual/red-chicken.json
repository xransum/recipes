        "Place flour, salt, and black pepper into a resealable plastic zipper bag, close the bag, and shake several times to mix. Place chicken pieces into the bag, a few at a time, and shake to coat with seasoned flour; place chicken into the prepared baking dish.",
        "Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the onion over the chicken pieces. Mix together the tomato sauce, water, chutney, sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, ground mustard, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl until the sugar dissolves. Pour the sauce over the onion and chicken.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling, the chicken is no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
