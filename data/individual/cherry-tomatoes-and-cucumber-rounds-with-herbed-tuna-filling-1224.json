        "Cut off 1/4 inch from tops of tomatoes. Gently squeeze out seeds. Cut thin slice from bottoms of tomatoes so that they will stand upright. Turn tomatoes top side up. Using small knife or melon baller, scoop out insides of tomatoes. Using tines of fork, score sides of cucumber lengthwise. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Using melon baller, scoop out some seeds in center of each round, being careful not too scoop through bottom. (Tuna mixture, tomatoes and cucumbers can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill. Pour off any excess liquid from tuna before continuing.) Spoon tuna into tomatoes and onto cucumber rounds."
