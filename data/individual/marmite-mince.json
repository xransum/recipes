        "Melt the butter in a wok over medium heat. Add the onions, and fry until soft. Crumble in the ground beef; cook and stir until evenly browned. Push all of the beef and onion out to the sides, leaving a pool of butter in the center. Add the yeast spread to the pool, and mix until dissolved. Stir into the ground beef.",
        "Mix in the paprika, and bouillon cubes. The mixture will start to become sticky and bind together. Mix in the water and gravy mix.  It will be sticky at first. Just stir and bring to a simmer, and it is ready to serve."
