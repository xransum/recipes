        "Stir warm water and honey together in a bowl until honey dissolves. Sprinkle yeast over water mixture and let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix 3 cups of flour into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is no longer sticky and pulls together. Continue kneading for 5 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand.",
