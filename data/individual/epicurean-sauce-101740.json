    "directions": [
        "Cook mushrooms slowly with 1/4 pound of butter until they are black and thoroughly mellow. This will take about 2 hours. The mushrooms should be very concentrated with a strong mushroomy odor. Add more butter if necessary during the cooking.",
        "When the mushrooms are thoroughly done add 6 more tablespoons of butter and flour. Blend this well and continue cooking the mixture for 1/2 hour more. Season to taste with salt and pepper and keep warm.",
        "Saut\u00e9 1 pound of chicken livers in 4 tablespoons of butter until they are lightly browned but not too well done. Shake the pan so the livers brown on all sides. When they are done, mash them thoroughly or put them through a food mill. Combine the mashed livers with the mushroom mixture. Rinse out the pan in which the livers were cooked with 1/4 cup of cognac and add this to the mixture. Taste for seasoning and add a pinch of nutmeg and a little chopped parsley. Keep this sauce warm and serve it with the turkey."
