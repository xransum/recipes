        "Brush zucchini, eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until each is tender. Put 2 tbsp olive oil and onion in a nonstick pan and saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat, stirring until onion becomes brown and syrupy, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Grill or toast both sides of each flatbread. Remove from heat and spread with bean puree. Layer on vegetables. Cut in half."
