        "In the stovetop-safe insert of a slow cooker over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up large chunks with tongs or a wooden spoon, until just browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the sloppy Joe starter. Transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base. Cover and cook on high for 2 hours according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
        "During the last 15 minutes of cooking, preheat a griddle over medium heat. Spread both sides of each bread slice with butter. Working in batches, cook the bread, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes total. Place 1 bread slice on each of 6 plates. Top with the sloppy Joe mixture, dividing evenly. Cover each with one of the remaining bread slices. Serve immediately with dill pickle spears and shoestring onions. Serves 6.",
