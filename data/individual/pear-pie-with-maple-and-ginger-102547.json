        "Whisk 6 tablespoons ice water and egg yolk in small bowl to blend. Mix flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Drizzle egg mixture over. Using on/off turns, process until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough together and divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other. Flatten into disks; wrap each disk in plastic and chill 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)",
        "Position 1 rack in center and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Toss first 8 ingredients in large bowl to coat.",
        "Roll out larger dough disk on lightly floured work surface to 12-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Transfer filling to crust. Roll out smaller dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Drape dough over filling. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Fold overhang under, pressing to seal and forming high-standing rim. Crimp edge decoratively. Brush crust with milk. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Cut several slits in top to allow steam to escape during baking.",
        "Place baking sheet on bottom rack to catch any juices that may bubble over. Bake pie on center rack until crust is golden brown and juices bubble thickly, tenting pie with foil if crust browns too quickly, about 1 hour. Transfer pie to rack and cool. Serve pie slightly warm or at room temperature."
