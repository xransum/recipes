        "Rinse the Brussels sprouts under cold water and reserve on a dry cloth to dry. Once dry, cut each sprout into quarters and place aside.",
        "Place the bacon strips on a cutting board and cut into 3/4-inch strips. In a medium saute pan, heat the lardons over medium heat until crisp. Strain the lardons out of the pan and place on paper towels. Keep the bacon fat in the pan, add the butter and heat until melted. Once the butter is melted, add the Brussels sprouts and stir frequently. Saute until the sprouts begin to brown. Add the lardons back to the sprouts and add the maple syrup. Heat until the syrup appears to stick to the Brussels sprouts and a deep caramelization is reached. Season with the salt and pepper."
