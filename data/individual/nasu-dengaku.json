        "Warm the apple juice, cranberry juice, and vinegar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in miso paste and agave nectar until smooth. Reduce heat to low to keep warm, stirring occasionally. Brush the cut side of the eggplants with sesame oil. Place the eggplants cut side down in a shallow baking pan.",
        "Broil in the preheated oven for 3 minutes, checking occasionally to ensure they do not burn. Turn eggplants over and broil until they become golden brown and tender, about 3 minutes. Spoon miso sauce onto each eggplant and continue broiling until miso becomes bubbly, about 1 minute. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion. Serve hot."
