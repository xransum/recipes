        "1. Pur\u00e9e the peaches in a blender and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium glass or metal bowl, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula to remove as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. You should have about 2 cups of pur\u00e9e. Add the tea, sugar, vodka, and corn syrup and stir until the sugar dissolves. Cover and refrigerate until the mixture is very cold (under 40\u00b0F), at least 4 hours, then mix well.",
        "2. Churn the sorbet in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. When finished, the sorbet will be thick and soft and can be served as a slushy. To make the sorbet firm enough to scoop, transfer into an airtight container, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the sorbet, and freeze until firm."
