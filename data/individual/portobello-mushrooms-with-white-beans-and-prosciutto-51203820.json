Brush caps with oil mixture; reserve remaining mixture. Bake until tender, 8 minutes. In a skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Cook shallots until soft, 2 minutes. Add garlic and rosemary; cook, 1 minute. Stir in beans and broth; season with black pepper. Remove from heat, stir in prosciutto and parsley and transfer to a bowl. In the same skillet over medium heat, cook spinach until wilted, 1 minute. Drain juice from caps and return to baking sheet, top down; brush with remaining oil mixture. Stuff caps with bean mixture and spinach. In a bowl, combine panko and Parmesan; divide among caps. Coat caps with cooking spray; bake until panko is golden, 10 minutes."
