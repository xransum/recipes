Put about 1 tablespoon raisins in cavity of peach half and, using a small spoon, top with some filling. Arrange another peach half on top of filling, cut side down, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Gather edges of phyllo together carefully, bunching up around peach, and press together to seal.

Make 5 more peach bonbons in same manner with remaining phyllo sheets, butter, peaches, raisins, filling and sugar.",
