        "Meanwhile, in a bowl, stir together the strawberries, lemon juice and sugar. Set aside.",

        "Using a serrated knife, slice 1 rectangle horizontally to create 2 layers. Use the uncut rectangle as the base. Top with half of the whipped cream and one-third of the strawberries. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to create 2 more layers, finishing with just strawberries. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar just before serving. Serves 6.",
