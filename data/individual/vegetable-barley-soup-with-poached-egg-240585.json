Add mushrooms and thyme to onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, stock, barley, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and simmer briskly, covered, stirring occasionally, until barley is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook 1 minute, then season with salt.",
