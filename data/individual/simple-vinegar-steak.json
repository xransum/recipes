        "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Beat eggs in a shallow dish, and set aside. Place flour in a separate dish. Dip steaks in flour, then in egg, then in flour again. Place in the hot oil, and fry on each side until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve immediately."
