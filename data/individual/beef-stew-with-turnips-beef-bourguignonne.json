        "In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onions and bacon and saut\u00e9 until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the onions and bacon to a plate and set aside.",
        "Working in batches, add the beef to the pot in a single layer; do not crowd the pot. Cook, uncovered, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. When all the meat is browned, return it to the pot, sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until the meat is evenly coated, about 1 minute. Return the onions and bacon to the pot and add the garlic. Using kitchen string, tie the parsley stems, thyme sprigs and bay leaves into a bundle and add to the pot as well.",
        "Increase the heat to high, pour in the wine and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the pot bottom. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the broth and tomato paste and stir well. Increase the heat to high, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the meat is tender when pierced with a knife, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
        "Remove the herb bundle and discard. Add the turnips, cover and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Add the turnip greens, cover and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the stew into warmed bowls and serve immediately."
