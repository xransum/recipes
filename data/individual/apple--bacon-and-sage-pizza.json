        "Wrap the garlic cloves in aluminum foil and roast in the oven until soft, about 20 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the flour and whisk until combined. Slowly pour in the milk, continuing to whisk over medium heat until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the cheese. When the garlic cloves are cool enough to handle, squeeze out the soft garlic pulp and stir into the sauce until combined. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover and set aside until ready to assemble pizza.",
