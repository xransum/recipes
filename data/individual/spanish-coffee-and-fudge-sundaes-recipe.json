        "Line dessert bowls with brownie squares or pound cake. Set coffee ice cream out to soften a bit. Heat hot fudge sauce over low heat or in the microwave. Place dark-roast coffee beans in a heavy duty plastic food storage bag and crush them with a small heavy skillet or mallet. If you have a coffee grinder, grind the beans on coarsest setting. Add beans to sauce with 1/4 cup (2 ounces), strong coffee. Scoop coffee ice cream on cake or brownies. Top with coffee fudge sauce and salted nuts and serve. WOW!"
