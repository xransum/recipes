        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Cook pasta in boiling water until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breast, and cook until browned on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and capers, and continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes longer. Remove chicken from pan.",
        "Using the same pan, add asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, and water to the juices remaining in the pan. Cover, and simmer until the broccoli and asparagus are tender. Layer pasta, chicken, and vegetables in a large platter or bowl to serve."
