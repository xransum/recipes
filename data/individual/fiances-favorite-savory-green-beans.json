        "Cook and stir the bacon, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat until the bacon has just started to brown, about 8 minutes; mix in the balsamic vinegar, water, salt, black pepper, and green beans. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer the green beans until almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in the bread crumbs. Remove the skillet from the heat, and sprinkle with Italian cheese blend. Adjust salt and black pepper to taste."
