Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chili sauce, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with black pepper, and remove from the heat.",

Cook on the preheated grill until the fish is no longer translucent in the center, and easily flakes with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Baste with the chili sauce while grilling. Serve the swordfish with lemon slices and the cucumber sauce."
