Transfer 1 cup potato to medium bowl; add butter and mash well. Mix in sugar, mint, salt and cinnamon, then egg. Whisk flour, breadcrumbs and baking powder into potato mixture to make dough.",
        "Pour enough oil into heavy medium saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch; heat oil to 325\u00b0F. Working in batches, drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls into oil. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve fritters hot with Yogurt-Mint Dip."
