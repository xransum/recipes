        "Mash the potatoes with the butter, milk and cheese until fairly smooth. Use a potato masher or a whisk. Mix in the bacon. Form balls about the size of large ice cream scoops, and place them on a greased baking sheet. Scrape the top and sides with a fork to make textured lines over the balls. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese over the top of each one.",
