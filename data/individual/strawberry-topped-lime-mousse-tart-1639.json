        "Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are ground but some small pieces still remain. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles fine meal. Blend in enough water by teaspoonfuls until mixture begins to form clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Press dough evenly over bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Freeze crust until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Bake crust until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool.",
        "Place lime juice in small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 10 minutes to soften. Bring 1/4 cup cream to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add white chocolate; stir until melted and smooth. Add gelatin mixture; stir to dissolve. Mix in peel. Chill until cold and beginning to thicken but not set, stirring often, about 45 minutes. Beat sugar, sour cream and remaining 1/2 cup cream to medium-stiff peaks in medium bowl. Fold whipped cream mixture into white chocolate mixture. Spoon mousse into crust. Chill until mousse sets, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",
