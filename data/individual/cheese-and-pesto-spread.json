        "Blend basil leaves, pine nuts, and garlic together in a blender until evenly chopped. Add Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, and olive oil; blend until smooth.",

        "Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into cheese mixture.",
        "Line a 3 1/2-cup mold with plastic wrap. Spread 1/4 the cheese mixture into the mold; top with 1/3 the basil pesto. Repeat layering 2 more times, ending with cheese mixture. Refrigerate until set, 6 to 24 hours. Turn mold onto a plate and remove plastic wrap."
