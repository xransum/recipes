        "Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add the sliced carrots, and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process. Once the carrots are cold, drain well, and place into a large glass or plastic bowl.",
        "Place the green pepper, onion, cucumber, celery, cauliflower, and broccoli into the bowl along with the carrot; set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, mustard, and salt until the sugar begins to dissolve. Whisk in the vegetable oil and condensed tomato soup until smooth. Pour the marinade over the vegetables, and stir until evenly blended. Cover, and marinate overnight in the refrigerator."
