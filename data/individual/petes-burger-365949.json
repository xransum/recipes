Place the patties on the grill and cook for 5 minutes, then turn and continue cooking for a couple of minutes until just done. A minute before you finish cooking the patties, lay the cheese slices on the patties and let melt. Remove and set aside to keep warm.",
        "Meanwhile, place a griddle, plancha or piastra suitable for an outdoor grill on the grill to preheat. Cook the onion on the griddle until golden. Cook the bacon on the griddle to your liking.",
