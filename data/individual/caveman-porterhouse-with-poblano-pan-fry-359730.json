        "Prepare barbecue (high heat) using hardwood lump charcoal. When charcoal is orange, spread out in even layer on lower grill rack. Use newspaper to fan excess ash from coals. Sprinkle steaks generously with coarse sea salt and cracked peppercorns. Arrange steaks in single layer directly atop hot embers and grill until cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Using long tongs, transfer steaks to plate. Using natural-bristle brush, remove any embers and loose ash from steaks. Tent steaks with foil and let rest 10 minutes.",
        "Add oil to 12-inch-diameter cast-iron skillet. Place skillet directly atop embers in grill. When oil begins to smoke, add chiles and all remaining ingredients to skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; saut\u00e9 until vegetables begin to brown, 2 to 5 minutes, depending on heat remaining from embers. Using oven mitts as aid, carefully lift skillet from barbecue. Season pan-fry with salt and pepper. Pour over steaks and serve."

        "Test-kitchen tip: Hardwood lump charcoal is made from pure wood (with no additives or fillers). As the name suggests, this type of charcoal comes in irregularly shaped lumps, unlike the uniformly shaped charcoal briquettes. Look for hardwood lump charcoal at natural foods stores, grill shops, and online at sites such as kindlin.com and wickedgoodcharcoal.com."
