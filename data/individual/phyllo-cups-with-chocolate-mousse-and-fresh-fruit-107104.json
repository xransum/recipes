        "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Generously butter every other cup in 12-cup muffin pan. Place 1 phyllo rectangle on work surface; cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap and damp cloth to prevent drying. Brush rectangle with melted butter; sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon hazelnuts. Place second phyllo rectangle atop first; brush with butter and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon hazelnuts. Repeat 3 more times; top with 1 more rectangle and brush with butter, making stack of 6 rectangles. Using small sharp knife and 6-inch-diameter plate as guide, cut out two 6-inch round stacks. Press each stack into 1 buttered muffin cup. Repeat procedure 2 more times, making 4 more phyllo cups (6 total).",
        "Bake phyllo cups until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Immediately lift phyllo cups from pan, twisting carefully to loosen; place on rack. Cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)",
        "Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, butter, 1/4 cup water, and espresso powder in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water); whisk constantly until thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160\u00b0F, about 3 minutes. Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Turn off heat; leave bowl over water.",
        "Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff and glossy. Remove chocolate from over water. Fold 1/3 of beaten whites into warm chocolate mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Cover and chill until set, at least 3 hours or overnight.",
        "Fill phyllo cups with mousse (reserve remaining mousse for another use). Top with raspberries and diced pears and serve."
