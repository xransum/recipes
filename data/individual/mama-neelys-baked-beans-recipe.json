        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven set over medium- high heat. Once it's hot, toss in the onion and garlic, and saute until the onion is tender, about 3 or 4 minutes. Add the sausage, and continue to cook until the meat has browned, about 4 minutes more. Stir in the pork and beans, ketchup, molasses, sugar, vinegar, mustard, and hot sauce. Bring the beans up to a simmer, then put in the hot oven for 45 minutes, uncovered, until the mixture is bubbly and thick."
