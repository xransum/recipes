        "Layer the ingredients in the order given in a one quart wide mouth canning jar. Firmly pack each ingredient in place.  It will be a tight fit, but all ingredients will fit in the jar.  Use pinking shears to cut an 8 or 9 inch circle from gingham, calico, or a seasonal fabric.  Place the fabric over the wide mouth lid and rim and secure with a rubber band.  Tie on a raffia or ribbon bow to cover the rubber band.  Attach a card to the ribbon or raffia with the following mixing and baking directions:",
