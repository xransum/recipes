        "Put pumpkin into a large pot. Pour 2 cups water over the pumpkin so the cubes are floating. Season pumpkin and water with turmeric and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the pumpkin is tender yet firm enough to retain shape, about 15 minutes.",
        "Grind 1/2 cup coconut, 3 red chile peppers, green chile pepper, 2 tablespoons water, and cumin seeds in a food processor until you have a paste; stir into the pumpkin mixture and bring again to a boil. Cook until the liquid has thickened and coats the pumpkin cubes, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the curry into a large serving bowl.",
        "Heat 2 teaspoons coconut oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 2 dried red chile peppers, mustard seeds, and black lentils in hot oil until they sputter, 2 to 3 minutes; pour over curry.",
        "Heat remaining teaspoon coconut oil in the skillet. Fry 1 tablespoon coconut in the hot oil until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour atop the curry. Garnish dish with curry leaves."
