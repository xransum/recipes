        "Add the oil to a large skillet set over medium-high heat.",
        "Set up your dredging stations: one rimmed plate for the eggs, one plate for the flour, and one plate for the bread crumbs. Using a fork, coat your chicken pieces first in the flour (shaking off any excess), then in the egg, then in the crumbs, pressing the chicken into the crumbs to thoroughly coat.",
        "Fry each breast in the oil for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. (I usually do two at a time, but I've been known to cram all of them in at once and then spend the entire meal wishing I had just sucked it up and waited the 6 extra minutes.) The cutlets are cooked when chicken is firm to the touch but not rock hard.",
        "Remove and drain the chicken onto a paper-towel-lined dinner plate tented with foil if you have more pieces to fry. Add more oil to the pan and fry the remaining breasts."

        "3/4 cup all-purpose flour",
        "1 1/2 cups plain bread crumbs or Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs that have been salted and peppered (see note)",
        "4 boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds), rinsed and patted dry and pounded like crazy"
