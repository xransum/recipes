        "Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Transfer to bowl using slotted spoon. Season veal with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour; shake off excess. Add 1 tablespoon butter to pan drippings in skillet and melt over medium-high heat. Add veal and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Divide veal between 2 plates; tent with foil to keep warm. Add wine to same skillet and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Boil until liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Mix in pine nuts, capers, minced sage and bacon. Season with pepper. Spoon sauce over veal. Garnish with sage leaves if desired and serve."
