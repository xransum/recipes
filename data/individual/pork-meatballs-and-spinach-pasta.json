Add spinach and continue cooking until pasta is cooked through but firm to the bite, about 3 minutes more. Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta cooking water and drain remaining water.",
        "Return pasta and spinach to the pot and stir in olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and reserved cooking water. Top pasta with meatballs before serving."
