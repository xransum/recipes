        "In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, onions, and chicken. Toss with olive oil until everything is lightly coated. Season with salt and pepper and continue to toss while adding lemon juice. Add enough lemon juice so that you can taste it in every bite. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. The longer it sets the more the flavors mesh together and the better it tastes!"
