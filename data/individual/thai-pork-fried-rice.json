        "Heat a large wok over high heat until small wisps of smoke rise from the wok. Pour peanut oil into the wok and quickly stir garlic into the hot oil, followed by pork. Cook and stir until pork is browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes.",
        "Stir rice into pork mixture; add soy sauce and fish sauce. Cook and stir mixture for about 30 seconds. Mix mung bean sprouts, onion, grape tomatoes, dried chiles, and cilantro into rice. Cook and stir until mung bean sprouts are slightly wilted and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "Push the fried rice up the sides of the wok, leaving a bare spot in the center. Pour beaten egg into the bare spot and scramble egg until firm and no longer runny, about 1 minute. Stir fried rice with scrambled egg, sprinkle with green onion and white pepper, and remove from heat. Squeeze lime juice over the top and toss rice lightly to combine. Remove dried chiles before serving."
