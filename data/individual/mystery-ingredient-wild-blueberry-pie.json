        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust pastry into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.",
        "Stir blueberries, sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add almond extract; stir to coat. Pour blueberry mixture into the prepared pie crust. Dot the blueberry mixture with butter pieces. Top with second pie crust, crimping the two crusts together. Brush top crust with milk. Make a few incisions with a knife into the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking. Wrap the edges of the pie with aluminum foil to avoid burning.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and continue baking until blueberry filling is bubbling and crust is browned, 20 to 25 more minutes. Cool before serving."
