        "Cut enough corn from cobs to measure 1 cup. In a small saucepan boil corn in water to just cover until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. In a colander drain corn and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Pat corn dry and cut tomatoes and radishes into 1/4-inch dice. Vegetables may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, covered.",
        "Pat pork dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill pork on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning it, until a thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 155\u00b0F., 15 to 20 minutes. (Alternatively, pork may be grilled in a hot lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Let pork stand 5 minutes and thinly slice. Chop fris\u00e9e and transfer with corn, tomatoes, radishes, beans, and pork to a large bowl.",
