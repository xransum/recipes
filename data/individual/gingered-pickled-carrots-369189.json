        "Peel the carrots and cut them into batons about 4 inches long by 1/2-inch thick. Toss with the ginger and pack into clean, sterilized jars.",
        "Combine 1 cup water with the vinegar, turbinado sugar, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the mixture over the carrots, leaving about 1/2 inch of space at the top of each jar.",
        "At this point the pickles are pretty much done but they will be at their best a day or two later. The shelf life, without hot canning processing, is about 10 days. With proper canning, it is 6 to 8 months."
