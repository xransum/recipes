        "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the leek and garlic in the melted butter until the leek softens and the garlic turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the Gouda until melted. Divide the cheese mixture among the chicken breasts; roll the chicken around the filling. Wrap each chicken breast with a slice of prosciutto, and secure with toothpicks. Place seam side down on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven and allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing and serving."
