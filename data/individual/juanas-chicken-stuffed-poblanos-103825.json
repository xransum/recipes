        "Lay 4 chiles on their sides on racks of gas burners and turn flames on high. (Or broil all 8 chiles on rack of a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat.) Roast chiles, turning with tongs, until skins are blistered but not blackened, 4 to 6 minutes (do not over roast because chiles may fall apart). Transfer immediately to a large plastic bag, then close to allow chiles to steam. Roast remaining chiles in same manner.",
        "Cook onion in oil in a medium nonstick skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until onion begins to turn golden, about 4 minutes. Add water and cook, stirring occasionally, until water is evaporated and onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Stir in chicken, salt, and pepper. Cool completely, then stir in cheese.",
