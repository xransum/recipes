        "In a heavy saucepan cook the leek and the garlic with salt and pepper to taste in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the leek just begins to soften, add the potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, and the broth, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the potato is very tender. In a blender pur\u00e9e the mixture in batches, transferring the soup as it is pur\u00e9ed to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Let the soup cool, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until it is cold, stir in the cream, the chives, and salt and pepper to taste, and divide the soup between 2 bowls."
