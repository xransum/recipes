        "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Roast steaks until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 125\u00b0F for rare, about 25 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest 10 minutes. To serve, cut the 2 whole pieces of meat (known as the loin and the fillet) from each steak, and slice. Give each guest a few slices of the loin and the fillet."
