        "In a bowl, combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, juice, cumin and salt. In a second bowl, mash beans; stir in chipotle. Working one at a time, top half of each tortilla with 1/4 avocado slices, 1/4 bean mixture, 1 cup spinach and 4 tablespoons cheese; fold in half. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add 1 quesadilla and cook, flipping once, until both sides are brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Let cool slightly; cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges; serve with tomato salsa."
