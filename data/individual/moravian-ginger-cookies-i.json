        "In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and molasses until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice; blend into the creamed mixture.  Work dough with hands until well blended. Cover and chill for about 4 hours.  Dough must be thoroughly chilled to hold together.",
