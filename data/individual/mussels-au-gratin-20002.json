        "Blend the butter and the seasoning together and let stand 1 hour. Scrub and beard the mussels. Place them in a heavy skillet or pot with onion and enough white wine to cover the bottom of the pot well. Cover and steam over a medium flame until the mussels open. When cool enough to handle, remove one half shell from each mussel. Spoon butter mixture on mussels and sprinkle with crumbs. Bake at 425\u00b0F. just long enough to heat through. Serve on hot plates."
