        "In a large nonreactive pot, combine the lemon juice, vinegar, oil, garlic, pickling salt, and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil. Add the artichokes, cover, and boil for 10 minutes.",
        "Have ready 2 clean pint jars and bands, and new lids that have been simmered in hot water to soften the rubberized flange. Remove the artichokes from the marinade with a slotted spoon and pack them into the jars, filling the jars about three-fourths full. Resist the temptation to overpack or you will compromise the seal. Cover the artichokes with the marinade, distributing the garlic and hot pepper evenly and leaving 1/2 inch of headroom. (Refrigerate any leftover marinade: It holds for months.) Wipe the rims, place on the lids, and screw on the bands fingertip tight.",
        "Process the jars in a water bath for 25 minutes. You can process 4 half-pints for the same amount of time. Be sure to make altitude adjustments when preserving.The artichokes will be ready to eat in 2 weeks."
