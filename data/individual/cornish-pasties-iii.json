        "To Make Crust: Place flour and salt in a large bowl. Mix well, then cut in lard until mixture is crumbly. Stir in water, mixing just until dough forms a ball. Allow dough to rest in refrigerator while you make filling.",
        "To Make Filling: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil, then onions. If using carrots and rutabagas, add them now. Saute vegetables until soft, about 10 minutes.",
        "Add ground beef, ground pork, and green onions to skillet. Saute until meat is no longer pink. Add salt and pepper to taste. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).",
        "Divide dough into 12 portions and roll out each one to fit a 9-inch pie plate.",
        "Place a pastry circle in a pie pan. Fill one half of pan with meat filling. Dot with some of the butter or margarine. Pat edge of crust with water, then fold over other half of crust. Trim edge, then crimp to seal. Make steam vents in top of crust. Brush with milk. Repeat process until all of dough and all of filling are gone.",
        "Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown."
