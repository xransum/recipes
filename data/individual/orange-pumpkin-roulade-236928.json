Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking powder, nutmeg, ginger and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer on high until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar until combined. Reduce speed to low; add pumpkin, zest and vanilla until just combined. Gently but thoroughly fold in flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan. Spread into an even layer. Sprinkle pecans on top. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Lightly dust a clean towel with confectioners' sugar. Remove cake from oven. Invert cake onto towel. Remove pan.

In another bowl, beat ricotta, cream cheese and confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer on medium until smooth. Beat in gelatin and candied peel. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Gently unroll cake; set towel aside. Spread top with even layer of filling, leaving a 1-inch border on the far side. Gently roll up cake. Place seam side down on a platter.
