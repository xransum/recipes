        "Place the chicken breasts into a shallow bowl, and drizzle with white wine; sprinkle with rosemary. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off excess marinade. Retain the marinade. Place the chicken breasts into the hot oil, and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Set the chicken breasts aside.",
        "Place the strawberries and strawberry yogurt in a blender, and pulse several times to puree. Pour the strawberry mixture into the skillet and stir in the marinade, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, scraping up and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet. Lay the chicken breasts into the strawberry sauce, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of a breast, should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Stir occasionally while simmering."
