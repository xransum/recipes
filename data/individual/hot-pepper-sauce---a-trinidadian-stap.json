        "Wearing disposable gloves, and being careful not to get any in your eyes or on your skin, roughly chop the habanero peppers. Place the habanero peppers, mango, onion, green onions, and garlic into a blender. Pour in the vinegar, lime juice, and vegetable oil, cover the blender, and pulse until the mixture is very finely chopped. Stop the blender, and add dry mustard powder, salt, curry powder, and lime zest. Blend again until the sauce is smooth. Pour into clean jars, and store in refrigerator."
