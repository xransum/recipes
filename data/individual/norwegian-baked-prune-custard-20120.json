        "Cover prunes with port and soak overnight, or simmer 5-10 minutes. The prunes should still retain their shape. Drain, and with sharp, pointed knife, pit prunes. Replace pits with whole almonds. Place prunes in baking dish. Beat egg yolks with sugar until thick and light. Heat cream and stir into egg yolk mixture. Beat in vanilla. Beat egg whites until stiff peak forms. Fold into custard. Pour custard over prunes. Bake in a 325\u00b0F. oven, or until custard is set. Chill. At serving time, decorate with whipped cream forced through a decorating tube."
