        "Rinse lentils; place in large pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the lentils by 2 inches; add the chicken bouillon cube to the pot.  Bring to simmer; cook until lentils are just tender, about 20 minutes.",
        "While lentils are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook chorizo until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan. In the same pan, lightly fry bacon until cooked but still soft, about 5 minutes.  Remove bacon, leaving drippings in pan. Chop bacon.",
        "Cook the tomato, tomatillo, onion, and garlic in the bacon fat until soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the water and cilantro; transfer mixture to a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree until smooth.",
        "Stir the pureed vegetables, cooked chorizo, cooked bacon, and cumin into the lentils and cooking water.  Stir over medium heat until hot, about 5 minutes. Serve in bowls; top each bowl with a teaspoon of cotija cheese and a dollop of sour cream."
